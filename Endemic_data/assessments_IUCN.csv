882795,161254,Vanessa virginiensis,Least Concern,,2020,2020-04-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Vanessa virginiensis</em>, also known as the American Lady, is found in open habitats with low-lying vegetation, such as meadows, fields, and grasslands throughout much of the Americas. Although it is common throughout much of its range, population size estimates and trends are unknown. Localized population declines due to habitat conversion and agricultural intensification in the Sacramento Valley of California are probably not pervasive across the range of this species. However, additional research on threats and monitoring of population numbers is needed to ensure range wide stability. Despite these localized trends, this species remains widespread, common, and there is little evidence of widespread threats. Therefore, <em>V. virginiensis</em> is assessed as Least Concern. </p>","<p><em>Vanessa virginiensis</em> can be found in a variety of open habitats with low vegetation, including grasslands, meadows, dunes, openings in forests, agricultural fields and gardens (Opler and Wright 1999). Larval host plants include members of the Asteraceae family, such as Cudweed (<em>Gnaphalium spp.</em>), Everlasting (<em>Anaphalis spp</em>.), and Pussytoes (<em>Antennaria spp</em>.), Wormwood (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>), Ironweed (<em>Veronia spp</em>.) and Burdock (<em>Arctium spp.</em>) (Opler and Wright 1999, Lotts and Naberhaus 2017). As adults, this species feeds almost exclusively on Dogbane <a name=""_Hlk37838118"">(<em>Apocynum spp.</em>)</a>, Aster (<em>Aster spp.</em>), Goldenrod (<em>Solidago spp.</em>), Marigold (<em>Tagetes spp.</em>), Self-heal (<em>Prunella spp.</em>), Milkweed (<em>Asclepias spp.</em>), and Vetch (<em>Vicia spp.</em>, <em>Astragalus spp.</em>, and <em>Lathyrus spp.</em>) (Lotts and Naberhaus 2017). </p>  <p>Adults cannot survive extended cold periods, so only inhabit the northern portions of their range, in the United States and Canada, during the summertime (Opler and Wright 1999). This slight migratory behavior never results in the sort of mass migrations seen in the related Painted Lady (<em>V. cardui</em>) (Brock 2008). In the northern portions of their range, there are three or four generations from May through November (Lotts and Naberhaus 2017). From coastal California, the Southwest, and the Deep South in the United States, through the Southern portions of its range, this species can be collected all year and probably has additional generations (Opler and Wright 1999). </p>","In areas where <em>Vanessa virginiensis</em> population declines appear to be taking place, the major threats include habitat conversion, agricultural intensification, and increased neonicotinoid pesticide use (Forister <em>et al.</em> 2011, Forister <em>et al.</em> 2016). While it is unclear which, if any, of these factors poses a threat to this species specifically, there is evidence these threats, as well as climate change, have caused population declines in other species of butterflies (Flockhart <em>et al. </em>2015, Warren <em>et al. </em>2001, Forister <em>et al. </em>2010). Considering the recorded declines in the Sacramento Valley of California, it is clear more research is needed to determine what threats may be impacting this species across its range.","<p>The total population size for this species is unknown. It is reportedly common throughout much of its range and <a name=""_Hlk37080886"">NatureServe (2020) estimates there could be as many as one million individuals globally.</a></p>    <p>Range wide population trend is also unknown, although declines across a 19 to 31 year period have been recorded at several sites in the Sacramento Valley of California (Forister <em>et al.</em> 2011). In this study, presence/absence data collected biweekly at two sites from 1976 to 2007, and at another two sites from 1988 to 2007,&#160;revealed declines of about 4-6% per year (Forister <em>et al.</em> 2011). This equates to a 33-45% decline over a ten year period. It is unlikely declines as high as these are present over the entire range of this species, as the region in question is likely subject to more habitat conversion and agricultural intensification (Forister <em>et al.</em> 2010) than elsewhere across the range. More research is needed to be certain similar declines are not taking place range wide.</p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Vanessa virginiensis</em> is widespread across the Americas. It is found as a year-round resident from coastal California and southern portions of the United States, throughout much of Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, to Columbia and Venezuela (Opler and Wright 1999, GBIF 2020). In the springtime, this species migrates north and is found throughout much of the United States, and into southern Canada (Opler and Wright 1999). It has colonized areas outside the Americas, including Hawai’i, and portions of southwest Europe, such as the Canary Islands, Madeira, mainland Portugal and western Spain (Opler and Wright 1999, GBIF 2020). It has been found as far north as Newfoundland and Labrador, and as far east as western Europe, as a vagrant (Opler and Wright 1999). </p>  <p>The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of this species where it is a resident is almost 18 million km<sup>2</sup>.&#160; The EOO of the entire range, including the areas where this species spends the summer, but not where it is non-native is closer to 26 million km<sup>2</sup>.&#160; </p>","<p><em>Vanessa virginiensis</em> is utilized by the Butterfly House Industry (BHI). The BHI is estimated to be worth about 100 million dollars (USD) a year, yet little regulation exists (Boppre and Vane-Wright 2012). It is therefore unclear how often this species is traded or collected from wild stock. More research is needed.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><a name=""_Hlk16762270""></a><a name=""_Hlk16687595"">Due to the ubiquity of this butterfly species, it likely occurs in many protected areas across the world. In North America, for example, it is found on the species checklist for Yosemite National Parks (NPS 2019, Protected Planet 2020). No specific conservation actions are needed at this time, but more </a><a name=""_Hlk16761882"">research should be done across the range of this species to ensure regional populations are stable and ample high-quality habitat remains to support the viability of this species.</a> Need for conservation effort should continue to be monitored via butterfly monitoring schemes such as The North American Butterfly Monitoring Network. </p>",Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

High demand for this species in the eastern African countries of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania has led to its inclusion onto Appendix II of CITES. Outside of this range it is free to trade this species as demand is much lower. It is assumed that globally the population is large, and population relatively stable.

The native range for the species is somewhat obscure as the species has been cultivated and disseminated for millennia for culinary, medical, ornamental, and cultural uses, and numerous natural hybrids of citron are found in areas where it is indigenous. It is suspected that the species originated in west central Himalaya and that its native range extends from the western Himalaya to Myanmar. Genetic movement between wild and cultivated populations is believed to be ongoing and has led to speculation that no truly wild populations exist, however, genetically wild populations have been recently reported from northeast India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for the species greatly exceeds the threshold for threatened values and it is suspected that this is reflected in the number of locations for the species, especially if further research identifies additional genetically wild populations across the native range. Uncertainty around the distribution status of wild populations also hampers evaluation of population status and threats in action. In northeast India, an area representing a considerable proportion of the native range, wild populations have declined as a result of harvesting and deforestation and the majority of individuals are thought to be confined to home gardens and agroforestry systems. Despite this, large tracts of suitable habitat remain available across northeast India and the Himalaya region, and it is estimated that reduction in habitat owing to deforestation is not significant enough to qualify for threatened categories.<br/><br/>At present, <em>Citrus medica</em>&#160;is therefore assessed as Least Concern. Further research focussed on identifying wild populations across the historic native range is necessary to precisely evaluate the contemporary distribution and population status for the species, and to verify the assigned conservation status. Research into rates of harvesting from the wild is certainly required, and a more specific evaluation of threats in action is also necessary once the distribution of genetically wild population is more thoroughly elucidated. As germplasm accessions are not held from wild populations growing within the native range, collection of representative material is recommended.","Citron is a straggly evergreen shrub or small tree, ranging in height from 3 to 5 m, with fruit borne on thorny branches. It is relatively short-lived compared to other <em>Citrus </em>species&#160;with a life expectancy of 15–18 years and is very sensitive to frost and intense heat and drought; citron is considered the tenderest of all <em>Citrus</em>&#160;species. Citron flowers throughout the year and flowers are borne in clusters of 5–20 blooms (Klein 2014, Jones 2016). The fruit is fragrant and typically oblong but demonstrates considerably phenotypic plasticity, with various shapes and smooth or rough fruits sometimes occurring on the same branch (Morton 1987). The fruit ripens from green to yellow or even orange (Klein 2014). It occurs in both primary and secondary forests in the foothills of the Himalayas, and may also grow in rural gardens (Barbhuiya <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).","As the precise distribution of genetically wild plants across the native range is not wholly understood, the evaluation of threats in action is more challenging. However, it is reported that in the eastern Himalayan region of northeast India, an area representing a considerable proportion of the native range, wild populations have undergone rapid decline as a result of natural and anthropogenic disturbances.<br/><br/>Natural populations are affected by harvesting and deforestation and the majority of individuals are confined to home gardens and agroforestry systems (Barbhuiya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In areas of northeast India and the Eastern Himalaya region, deforestation and degradation of forest habitat is ongoing (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2005, Chatterjee 2008) and, within India, the northeast states have been identified as the region of greatest contemporary deforestation, along with the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Reddy <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Major drivers of land use change across northeast India and the Eastern Himalaya are shifting cultivation (<em>jhum</em>), encroachment for grazing and timber extraction, and an increase in commercial agricultural plantations (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2005, Chatterjee 2008).<br/><br/>However, despite the threat posed by ongoing deforestation, there remain large tracts of intact subtropical forests across the native range, particularly in Bhutan and areas of northeastern India and northern Myanmar with lower population densities (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2005, Renner <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Additionally, if the presence of genetically wild populations in the western Indian Himalaya is confirmed, this would represent another relatively intact area of forest habitat (BirdLife International 2020). In fact, with the exclusion of Assam and Tripura, forest cover in the northeastern states has fallen by less than 20% since 1930 (Reddy <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016); as such, it is estimated that habitat availability across three generations would not qualify for threatened categories on the basis of past reduction.<br/><br/>The citron tree is subject to most of the pests that attack other <em>Citrus</em>&#160;species (Morton 1987), however, the pest and disease burden on wild individuals is not well documented.&#160;The severity of overharvesting as a threat is not clear. As the species is commonly grown in rural gardens, and plays a cultural rather than commercial role in southeast Asia (Jones 2016), it is suspected that the collection pressure on wild populations is somewhat mitigated. However, further research into rates of harvesting from the wild is certainly required, and a more specific evaluation of threats in action is also necessary once the distribution of genetically wild population is more thoroughly elucidated.","Numerical population information for citron is limited, and truly wild populations are difficult to isolate as numerous natural hybrids of citron are found in areas where it is indigenous, with genetic movement between wild and cultivated populations suspected to be ongoing (Barbhuiya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Jones 2016); together, these factors make it challenging to reliably assess the population status. However, it is reported that in the eastern Himalayan region of northeast India, wild populations have undergone rapid decline as a result of natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Barbhuiya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). As this region represents a considerable proportion of the global native range, it is inferred that the global population trend may be decreasing. In order to ascertain the population size and verify the direction and magnitude of population change, it is recommended that quantification of populations is a component of research into identifying genetically wild populations across the native range.",Decreasing,"The native range for citron is thought to span from the western-central Himalaya to Myanmar (POWO 2019). All citrus forms are thought to have originated from South East Asia but it has been suggested that the citron may have had a comparatively westerly origin in the central Himalayan foothills (Weisskopf and Fuller 2013, Langgut 2017).<br/><br/>Delineating a precise native range for the species has represented a challenge as the species has been cultivated and disseminated for millennia, with seeds found in Mesopotamian excavations dating back to 4000 B.C. The armies of Alexander the Great are credited with introducing the plant to the Mediterranean region by about 300 B.C., although there is evidence that it may have been introduced earlier by coreligionists or local Persian rulers in ancient Palestine/Judea (Morton 1987, Klein 2014). Establishing the contemporary extent of occurrence for the species within this native range is also difficult as numerous natural hybrids of citron are found in areas where it is indigenous, and movement between wild and cultivated populations by natural or artificial means is suspected to be ongoing (Barbhuiya <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Jones 2016). This has led to some speculation that the species no longer occurs in truly wild situations (Tropical Plants Database; Fern 2020); however, genetically wild populations have recently been reported from the Indian states of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur, as well as Myanmar and Chittagong District in Bangladesh (Morton 1987, Barbhuiya <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Wu <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).<br/><br/>Citron has been observed to grow well up to 1,300 m asl in the tropics (Jones 2016). Further research focused on identifying wild populations across the historic native range is necessary to precisely evaluate the contemporary distribution status for the species.","Citron is a primary wild relative of cultivated Citron, and a close wild relative of all cultivated&#160;<em>Citrus</em>&#160;spp. (USDA, Agricultural Research Service, National Plant Germplasm System 2020). Citron is considered to have been a parental contributor to several cultivated&#160;<em>Citrus</em>&#160;accessions, predominantly acting as the male parent (Nicolosi&#160;<em>et&#160;al.</em>&#160;2000, Wu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Through combination with sour orange (<em>Citrus x aurantium</em>), citron contributed to the origin of lemon (<em>Citrus x limon</em>), bergamot (<em>Citrus x bergamia</em>), and key lime (<em>Citrus x aurantifolia</em>) (Barkley&#160;<em>et&#160;al.</em>&#160;2006, Ollitrault&#160;<em>et&#160;al.</em>&#160;2010, Barbhuiya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Wu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).<br/><br/>The four main uses of citron are as an ornamental tree (Andrews 1961), a culinary plant, a medicinal plant and as a liturgical fruit (Brigand and Nahon 2016). In culinary use, the most important part of the citron is the peel (Morton 1987, Jones 2016). The peel is eaten with rice in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, and the fruit may be pickled in India (Morton 1987, Sarker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In other areas of the world, the peel is used in culinary preparations on a commercial scale, particularly through candying of the peel for use in cakes and other sweet produce. The fruits are also made into marmalade and jams, and the fruit juice can be used in beverages and to make desserts. In Spain, the peel is used to make a syrup to enhance the flavour of medicines (Morton 1987). Historically, the leaves, flowers and fruit were used more widely in gastronomy (Brigand and Nahon 2016).<br/><br/>In traditional medicine, multiple plant parts have been used to treat conditions including asthma, arthritis, dysentery, headache, malaria, stomachache, intestinal parasites and some psychological disturbances (Tropical Plants Database, Ken Fern 2020). In India, the peel is used as a remedy for dysentery and halitosis (Morton 1987). In China, the candied peel is sold as a stomachic, stimulant, expectorant and tonic, and decoctions of the root are used to treat respiratory problems and backache (Morton 1987, Tropical Plants Database, Ken Fern 2020).&#160;In southeast Asia, a decoction of the fruit is used to deter spirits, while a decoction of the shoots is prescribed for stomachache and intestinal parasites. The seeds are given as a vennifuge, an infusion of the leaves is used as an antispasmodic, and the leaf juice is taken following childbirth. In Panama, the seeds are used in an antidote against poison, and in west tropical Africa, the citron is used to treat rheumatism (Morton 1987). Contemporary research has demonstrated that various parts of the plant exhibit anti-catarrhal, capillary protector,&#160;anti-hypertensive, diuretic, antibacterial, antifungal, anthelmintic, antimicrobial, analgesic, strong antioxidant, anticancerous, antidiabetic, estrogenic, antiulcer, cardioprotective, and antihyperglycemic properties (Lou <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The nanoemulsion of essential oil from <em>Citrus medica</em>&#160;var. <em>sarcodactylis</em>&#160;has confirmed antioxidant, antibacterial and antibiofilm activity (Chhikara <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The properties of specific cultivars have been recognised for their relevance to treatment of cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (Conforti <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Entezari <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Citron juice has also been utilised in an eco-friendly method to synthesise copper nanoparticles (Shende <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The fruit has long played an important role in Jewish ritual during the autumn harvest festival of Sukkot (Klein 2014, Langgut 2017). In east Asia, the fruit is prized for its fragrance and the essential oil was formerly used in perfumery. A ripe fruit is often used to air a room, dried fruits are placed with stored clothes as an insect repellent and the juice is used to wash linens. In India, branches of the tree are used as walking sticks (Morton 1987).<br/><br/>It should be noted that most of the described uses primarily rely on cultivated individuals grown outside the native range, but it is challenging to identify whether the use of wild individuals is excluded entirely; in southeast Asia, the fruit predominantly plays a cultural rather than commercial role and this is unlikely to change (Jones 2016).",Terrestrial,"The genus&#160;<em>Citrus</em>&#160;is listed in Annex I of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) which aims to guarantee sustainable agriculture and food security through the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, as well as ensuring the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use (FAO 2009).&#160;Most germplasm collections of <em>Citrus</em>&#160;species also include citron (Jones 2016). There are 107&#160;<em>Citrus medica&#160;</em>germplasm accessions held worldwide, with the majority held by the National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Citrus &amp; Dates; however, only seven of these accessions are of wild origin and all were collected outside the native range for the species (Genesys Global Portal on Plant Genetic Resources 2020).<br/><br/>Seventy botanical gardens are listed as sites of&#160;<em>ex situ</em>&#160;conservation for this species (BGCI 2020), however, it is suspected that some of the listed living collections may hold cultivated varieties. The species is reported to have been collected in close proximity to the Nokrek National Park in India, and the Pyin-O-Lwin Bird Sanctuary in Myanmar (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2020); if the species occurs within the boundaries of these protected areas, passive conservation is presumed, however, it is not clear whether active management is apparent. As the native range overlaps with many more protected areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2020), it is suspected that the species may occur in some of these.<br/><br/>In 2013, the species was assessed as Least Concern in China (Qin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).

It is native to the North Africa, the Caucasus, Turkey, Syria and Europe from Greece to Slovenia. The species has been introduced to much of Europe and is also naturalized here. The large native range of the species suggests the species has a large population, although its distribution is discontinuous. The species is globally assessed as Least Concern. There are no major threats to the species although it is susceptible to a variety of pests and disease. In the future these may be a greater threat to the species alongside being adversely effected by climate change causing habitat alteration and northward shift in species range. These future threats require investigation and monitoring. The species is well represented in <em>ex situ </em>collections. More information needs to be gathered for the species in Africa, Syria and Lebanon.","This large tree species can grow up to 35 m in height (Conedera <em>et al. </em>2016). The species is relatively fast growing and can live for up to 1,000 years (Conedera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). It is relatively climate sensitive, enjoying a mean monthly temperature of 10°C and rainfall of 800 mm a year. It is not drought tolerant and is sensitive to frost. The species can be found on nutritionally poor and fairly acidic soils but they must be well drained. The species is able to germinate in the shade but light is required for further growth (Conedera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). The species is wind or insect pollinated but is also very good at re-sprouting (Fernández-López <em>et al. </em>2003). <em>Castanea sativa </em>grows in pure stands or within mixed broad leaf forests in association with other hardwood species. Within mixed forests the species often makes up over 50% of forest cover (Conedera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Pridnya <em>et al. </em>1996). The flowers are a good source of pollen and nectar for bees and other insects. It grows in the Habitats Directive listed habitat 9260 ""<em>Castanea sativa </em>woods"". It is also found within human landscapes; parks, gardens and orchards.","Within the Caucasus the species has historically been threatened by disease and logging. Disease still threatens the species as it is susceptible to many pathogens, those of greatest concern are the fungal pathogen&#160;<em>Chryphonectria parasitica </em>and species of <em>Phytophora </em>which result in chestnut dieback and dessication (Pridnya <em>et al. </em>1996, Aghayeva 2001). Loss of individuals to pests and diseases is likely to increase due to climate change making environments more suitable and international trade catalysing the spread of potential infections. Wild populations are at risk from genetic intogression with cultivated populations which is reducing the overall species genetic diversity (Fernández-López <em>et al. </em>2003). This is of greatest concern where orchards are being abandoned across Europe (Fernández-López <em>et al. </em>2003); this increases disease susceptibility of the species. A lack of management of forests can result in them being out-competed by other tree species (Conedera <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Pridnya <em>et al. </em>(1996) reports a lack of regeneration of <em>Castanea sativa </em>within forests of The Caucasus Biosphere Forest Preserve where average age of trees is 130 years with very few trees being less than 40 years old. The species is also likely to be adversely affected by climate change, due to the species in tolerance to drought. It is likely there will be a decline in the suitable habitat for the species (EFDAC 2015). Wild populations may also still be affected by the species use for timber however this will be much reduced due to the management and cultivation of timber forests.","In the Caucasus 90% of <em>Castanea sativa </em>forest is found on southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, other isolated stands can be found on the northern slopes (Pridnya <em>et al. </em>1996). In 1956 there was an estimated 70,000–80,000 hectares of <em>C. sativa </em>forest within the Caucasus but in western Caucasus this is estimated to have decreased by approximately two thirds or 50,000 ha between 1956 and 1996 (Pridnya&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996). Within Azerbaijan pure&#160;<em>Castanea sativa </em>forests are rare. Here it is found in fragmented mixed forests on south macroslopes of the Great Caucasus and in the Minor Caucasus the species is found over 550 to 600 km in small fragments, not all of which are wild stands. Population decline between 45–50% in Azerbaijan has been reported (Aghayeva 2001). Thirty-eight semi-wild stands have been identified within Lebanon (Masri <em>et al. </em>2009). The species is relatively genetically diverse; individuals within Turkey show the greatest genetic diversity <em>(</em>Fernández-López <em>et al. </em>2003). There is no population information for the species within Africa. Within Europe the species is widespread, common and widely cultivated. Overall due to the wide native range of the species population is likely to be large and stable. It is however reported that the species population is discontinuous in most parts of its range (Fernández-López <em>et al. </em>2003) and it is not considered a dominant species.",Stable,"This species is native to North Africa, the Balkan Peninsula, the Caucasus, Russia, Turkey and western Asia. The species has been cultivated and naturalised outside its native range especially within Europe (GRIN 2017, EURO+MED 2017). It has been introduced to the UK south to the Mediterranean and across into central and eastern Europe (February 2017). Across some of this introduced range the origin of the species is uncertain such as in Spain (Arbolapp 2017) and in Belarus. As such the species native range may be wider but this requires further investigation. Within Russia the species is only found within Ciscaucasia (Pridnya <em>et al. </em>1996) and within Lebanon the species origin is still contested (Masri <em>et al. </em>2009). The species is more common at elevations below 1,000 m asl but can still be found above this, up to 1,300 m asl. The species has a large extent of occurrence (EOO) which exceeds the criteria for a threatened category under criterion B.","This species is used for its timber (Mark <em>et al. </em>2014). For this purpose the species is managed by coppicing. Wood produced is used to make barrels, furniture, poles, other small products and also for construction (Conedera <em>et al. </em>2016). The wood can also be used to make charcoal and as fuel. The nut can be harvested for human consumption hence many cultivars of the species have been developed and the tree is grown in orchards (Conedera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In Croatia, more than 144,000 kg of fruits were collected between 2005–2011 (I. Boršić pers. comm. 2013). In Corsica, chestnuts are used to brew beer as they are similar to wheat (Kew 2017).

69047375,19218731,Ulmus minor,Data Deficient,,2017,2017-01-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Ulmus minor </em>is a medium sized tree species. It has a wide distribution, ranging from Portugal across southern and eastern Europe to North Africa, the Caucasus and the Middle East. Population numbers are large but are suspected to be in decline due to outbreaks of Dutch elm disease (DED) –caused by pathogen <em>Ophiostoma ulmi </em>and <em>O. novo-ulmi</em>, which is damaging to the species. Although the species is listed as Threatened in some European countries there is a lack of data on species decline and numbers across its entire range; therefore the species is classed as Data Deficient. The species is also assessed as Data Deficient as we do not know the species origin across all of its range. It is recommended that information on the full extent of the threat of disease is gathered and the impact of other threats (such as habitat loss) on the population are investigated.","<em>Ulmus minor </em>is a deciduous, riparian tree inhabiting the banks of streams and rivers (EUROFOGEN 2016). The species is fast growing and can reach heights over 20 m. It is tolerant of waterlogging, saline soils and winds, drought and pollution and hence is often grown as a pioneer species (EUROFOGEN 2016). The species inhabits and preferentially grows in warmer, drier habitats that other <em>Ulmus </em>spp. (Collin 1999-2001). This species can be found in association with ashes (<em>Fraxinus spp.</em>), poplars (<em>Populus spp.</em>), alders (<em>Alnus spp.</em>) and other <em>Ulmus </em>species with which it is able to hybridise (EUROFOGEN 2016). It uses suckers as its main method of reproduction hence the species has good regeneration potential and can quickly take over abandoned sites (Collin 1999-2001).","Within Europe the species is severely affected and damaged by DED caused by the fungus <em>Ophiostoma novo-ulmi </em>and historically by&#160;<em>Ophiostoma&#160;ulmi</em>. The disease does not cause the tree to die; the species is able to re-sprout as a shrub however these are unable to produce seeds leading to population decline. The disease is present in Asian countries within the&#160;<em>Ulmus minor</em>'s distribution but the impact of the disease on these populations is unknown (CABI 2017). The disease was also previously reported in Tunisia but is now thought to be absent, so African populations may be less at risk of from the disease then those in Asia and Europe (CABI 2017). The species exhibits great genetic diversity which is likely to have bolstered the species against greater declines.<br/><br/><em>Ulmus minor </em>is also threatened by habitat reduction and water regulation within Europe (Caudullo and de Rigo 2016). There is also the risk of hybridisation with <em>Ulmus pumila.</em>","Historic outbreaks of DED have caused the death of many adults of this species: however <em>Ulmus minor </em>remains common within Europe (EUROFOGEN 2017). The effect of this pathogen is not known within the species wider distribution. Within Sweden specifically, <em>Ulmus minor </em>occurs in 50,000 locations but the population is expected to decline by up to 80% (Artdatabanken 2015). It is not known if this predicted decline is representative of the global population. There is also a lack of information and data on past declines of the species throughout it distribution.",Unknown,"<em>Ulmus minor </em>occurs across Europe, being found from Portugal, across to the Balkan states and south to Italy, Greece and Turkey. It is also found within the Caucasus, Russia, Israel, Palestine and North Africa (Dannin 2016, GBIF 2017, Tutin <em>et al. </em>1964, GRIN 2017). The species origin within its more northern range needs clarification as the species may not be native here. It has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of over 11,700,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The species altitudinal range is not known.","The timber of this species is of high quality and is thus suitable for furniture, flooring and firewood. It is very resistant to decay from water and is very useful for underwater applications and for building ships (EUFORGEN 2016). This species was traditionally used as a living support for grapevines and as fodder for grazing livestock in the summer months (Caudullo and de Rigo 2016).",Terrestrial,"This species is recorded in 65 <em>ex situ </em>collections from across the globe (BGCI 2017). Often the species is protected within Riparian landscapes, but this does not always protect the species from DED (Collin 1999-2001). Within Sweden trees infected with dutch elm diseases are identified and burnt and the stumps treated to reduce disease spread (Artdatabanken 2017).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ulmus minor </em>has had a variety of country scale conservation assessments, listing the species as follows:<br/><ul><li>Least Concern in the United Kingdom (Cheffings and Farrell 2005)</li><li>Near Threatened in Switzerland (Moser <em>et al. </em>2002)</li><li>Vulnerable in Albania (MEA 2013)</li><li>Critically Endangered in Sweden (Artdatabanken 2017)</li></ul>Within Europe the species has been classed as Data Deficient and it is recommended that information be gathered on past, present and future decline of the species (2016).<strong> </strong>Data should be gathered on population and disease threat within the species non-European range. Due to DED having the greatest impact on <em>U. minor </em>it is essential that there is continued collaboration between <em>in situ </em>and <em>ex situ </em>conservation efforts, to ensure suckers are protected alongside maintain species genetic diversity in <em>ex situ </em>collections (Collin 1999-2001). The broad sampling of genetic resources has helped maintain the genetic integrity of this species which is of particular importance as it has been, historically, so widely cultivated. The species is of conservation priority and hence is featured in EUFORGEN projects and the Noble Hardwoods Network (Collin 1999-2001). In different parts of France clonal individuals which show tolerance to DED are slowly being reintroduced into mixed woodlands and within distance from each other to encourage cross breeding (Collin <em>et al. </em>2013). Within the UK, where DED has nearly eliminated the entire population of Elms, 'The Great British Elm Experiment' has propagated cuttings from mature, resistant trees which are now being distributed across the country to various community groups and schools to try to re-establish populations. These trees will be monitored (The Conservation Foundation 2017).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is therefore assessed as Least Concern.,"<em>Tribulus terrestris </em>is an annual creeping herb. Its flowers are small and solitary with five yellow petals and its fruits are woody, bearing two sets of sharp spines which attach to animals and humans (Akram <em>et al.</em> 2011). Flowering and fruiting occur from April to August (Umadevi and Srinathrao 2017). Pollination is done by insects including ants and bees, but in the absence of pollinators, this bisexual species is able to self-pollinate through the stamens and corolla bending so that the stamens come into contact with the stigma. Insect pollinators are encouraged, though, through the provision of sustenance (Reddi <em>et al.</em> 1980).&#160;<em>T. terrestris</em> can grow in a wide range of conditions. It is most commonly found in sandy soil and in wind-blown areas, but also can grow in compacted soil, as well as heavier, more fertile soils (El-Ghareeb 1991).&#160;The spines on the fruit allow it to be dispersed over large distances (Sorensen 1984). It is a C4 plant and possesses adaptations for thriving in dry conditions, even enduring droughts (Chen <em>et al.</em> 2019). These adaptations include xeromorphic leaves and an extensive tap root system which is extremely efficient at extracting water from the soil. It is sensitive to excess water and grows poorly in waterlogged soils (Nikolova and Vassilev 2011). As a result of its efficient moisture extraction, as well as its leachate habit which inhibits growth in other plants, it often reduces populations of other species and is considered a weed and agricultural nuisance (El-Ghareeb 1991). It is reported as affecting many crops including cotton and maize (Memon&#160;<em>et al. </em>2007, Verdu and Mas 2006). In addition, this species is poisonous when consumed by livestock and the fruits can puncture the stomach lining of animals (Sorensen 1984). In California, two species of weevil were introduced as a biological control, and after twenty years caused a substantial reduction in viability of seed and <em>T. terrestris</em> cover (Huffaker<em> et al. </em>1983).","There are no significant threats to this species, however, as the species is collected from the wild it is possible that in some areas it is over-exploited (Evstatieva and Tchorbanov 2011).","This species has a very large distribution over a number of countries so it is suspected that the population is large; there are no known major threats so it is also suspected that the population trend is stable.

It grows at elevations of 0–3,000 m asl in the tropical and subtropical regions (Akram&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011) and up to 3,800 m asl in Tibet (Wang 2003).","The use of this species has been traced back 5,000 years in India and China (Bartram 1995). It is still used today in traditional medicine systems of many countries, with its most common use as a hormone booster to help treat sexual dysfunction (Evstatieva and Tchorbanov 2011). It is also effective as a diuretic and in treating kidney stones and other kidney diseases. In Chinese medicine, the fruits are used to treat eye problems, edema, and abdominal problems, and the root is used for rheumatism, piles, menorrhagia, headaches, and dizziness. In Ayurveda, it is most well known for being a diuretic, treating venereal diseases, and for its aphrodisiac properties (Umadevi and Srinathrao 2017). Studies have found it is effective in decreasing blood sugar levels, protecting heart cells and improving heart function, inhibiting cancer cells, and increasing testosterone levels. Most of these biological effects are due to high levels of steroidal saponins (Umadevi and Srinathrao, 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>This species has also been promoted and used as an herbal supplement to increase athletic performance; however, studies have found that it does not increase muscle mass or strength (Rogerson <em>et al.</em> 2007, Antonio <em>et al.</em> 2000).

Really big trees are rare because of past exploitation, enormous specimens are now 'monuments' for tourists to see. But trees in all age classes in extensive forests now occupy the entire pine belt ('Corona Forestal') on all sides of Pico del Teide on Tenerife. There is no evidence of cutting or recent fires and the authorities are well aware of the importance of retaining forest cover on the extremely permeable volcanic 'soil' of the island in order to ensure water supplies. Exploitation of its timber has been banned and this ban is strictly enforced. Similar improvements have occurred on other islands. Although the extent of occurrence and the actual area of occupancy fall below the IUCN's thresholds, there is no current or ongoing decline. Past decline has not only been halted, it has been reversed due to active management and protection. On this basis, and at this time, an assessment of Least Concern is appropriate.","In the Canary Islands this species predominantly occupies areas at altitudes from 1,200 m to ca. 2,200 m asl. It grows well on exposed mountain slopes of volcanic origin amidst or on old lava flows and on scoria. Winter snow and frost limit its altitudinal range upwards (Pico del Teide is 3,718 m); at lower elevations a thermophile woodland and/or xerophytic scrub vegetation, interspersed with rare evergreen lauraceous woodland on N-facing slopes and in moist gullies, dominates. <em>Pinus canariensis</em> is dominant within this pine belt where it exists, but spring-flowering legumes and other herbs and shrubs may be common. Some common shrubs are <em>Adenocarpus foliolosus</em>, <em>Chamaecytisus proliferus</em>, and <em>Cistus symphytifolius</em>. The pine woods are characteristically very open and sunny and often there is nothing else on the ground than rocks, pine needles and great numbers of the large seed cones rolled into hollows. Some remnant stands occur at altitudes as low as 500 m.","Extensive logging in the past combined with destructive forest fires at one time reduced the area of occupancy (AOO) very substantially. However, extensive replanting since the 1950s and regrowth and better management, as well as cessation of exploitation, have restored most of the pine forests, even if large trees are now very rare. The fire hazard still remains and may become more acute with the ever increasing tourism and its ramifications, and with climate change if this tends to lengthen periods of drought on the islands where this species is indigenous. Development, especially on Tenerife, is encroaching into the pine belt (""corona forestal""), which once encircled the volcano and mountain spur to the northeast, but is no longer contiguous.","<p>The largest populations are on Tenerife and Gran Canaria, the populations on La Palma, El Hierro and La Gomera are much smaller.

The species breeds during the local spring (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a)as isolated pairs in well-defended territories (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). After breeding the adults may gather in large concentrations of thousands or more (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988) on selected waters (Madge and Burn 1988) (non-breeders in northern Europe migrating to such gatherings (Snow and Perrins 1998)) between July and August (Scott and Rose 1996) to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for 6-8 weeks (Kear 2005a). Although not noticeably sociable in many areas during the winter (Johnsgard 1978) the species may flock in groups of several thousands on favoured waters (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits a variety of lowland freshwater wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) such as shallow lakes (Kear 2005a), ponds (Madge and Burn 1988), lagoons, marshes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and slow-flowing rivers (Kear 2005a) (showing a preference for clean, weed-filled streams over larger, polluted rivers) (Johnsgard 1978). It is also common on artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs, gravel-pits, ornamental lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), ditches (Snow and Perrins 1998) and canals (Scott and Rose 1996), and will graze on grassland and agricultural land (e.g. arable cereal fields) (Kear 2005a). Moulting congregations of adults and non-breeders (Snow and Perrins 1998) may also utilise brackish or saline habitats (Johnsgard 1978) including brackish marshes (Kear 2005a), estuaries and sheltered coastal sites (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (e.g. brackish lagoons (Kear 2005a) and bays (Madge and Burn 1988)). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of leaves and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and grasses (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978) and grain (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), occasionally also taking small amphibians (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (frogs, toads and tadpoles) (Snow and Perrins 1998) and aquatic invertebrates (e.g. molluscs, insects and worms) (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a large mound of aquatic vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a) placed close to or floating on shallow water (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a) or amongst reeds (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Breeding pairs often re-use nesting sites from previous years if the it was successful (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Management information </strong>The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK resulted in an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes and in turn led to an increase in the winter use of the habitat by the species (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994). A control of the breeding output of the species (brood reduction) carried out in the Wylye Valley, UK to try to alleviate the species's negative impacts on fisheries (e.g. by overgrazing submergent riverine vegetation) was found to be ineffective as it had an insignificant impact on local population sizes (possibly due to immigration from surrounding areas) (Watola <em>et al</em>. 2003).","The species suffers heavy losses from lead poisoning due to ingested lead fishing weights (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kelly and Kelly 2004), lead shot (Spray and Milne 1988) and lead contaminated sediments from mining and smelting activities (Day <em>et al.</em> 2003). Heavy losses have also been recorded from local incidences of copper poisoning (Kobayashi <em>et al</em>. 1992). The ingestion of or entanglement in fishing lines and/or hooks can also cause severe injury or mortality (Kelly and Kelly 2004) as can collisions with overhead lines (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). The species may be threatened by future oil spills (which can cause death by oil saturation) (Berglund <em>et al.</em> 1963). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006)(e.g. strain H5N1) (Nagy <em>et al.</em> 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus.&#160;Significant mortality can occur with prolonged freezing weather in winter which prevents birds from feeding (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).","The global population is estimated to number approximately c.598,000-615,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

It breeds from mid-May to late-June or early-July (Kear 2005a) in territorial pairs (Madge and Burn 1988) which may form loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) of not more than c.10 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). After breeding the species undergoes a flightless moulting period in July and August that lasts for c.25 days (Scott and Rose 1996), during which it remains close to open water (such as the sea or early thawing lakes) (Kear 2005a). Icelandic non-breeding flocks migrate to staging areas (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) in east Greenland to moult, whereas breeding birds from Svalbard, Greenland and Iceland remain near their breeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996). After moulting the species departs from its breeding and staging grounds (Kear 2005a) from August to mid-September (Madge and Burn 1988), most arriving on the wintering grounds in October (Madge and Burn 1988). Outside of the breeding season the species remains highly gregarious (Madge and Burn 1988), generally forming large concentrations in the autumn (commonly up to 5,000 in the UK) (Snow and Perrins 1998) and in winter (Madge and Burn 1988). These aggregations are usually loose however, with large roosting flocks dispersing into smaller foraging groups by day (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species roosts on water by night and forages in nearly all hours of daylight (Kear 2005a). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on rocky outcrops, crags, steep river gorges (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a), cliffs, riverbanks and snow-free hummocks near areas of lush vegetation (Greenland) (Kear 2005a) in open arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), especially near seabird colonies (Kear 2005a). Later in the summer the species forages chiefly on damp sedge-meadows, and while moulting and flightless it remains close to the sea or early-thawing lakes (Kear 2005a). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species overwinters on extensive areas of saltmarsh (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) in estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and on flat agricultural land (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (e.g. improved or fertilised grasslands, stubble fields, pastures and newly sown cereal fields) (Kear 2005a). In Scotland favoured winter daytime roosting sites include estuarine mudflats, lochs and reservoirs (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Diet </strong>The species is hebivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and an opportunistic forager (Kear 2005a). <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season its diet consists of the leaves, stems, roots, berries and seed-heads of sedges, mosses, lichens (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), <em>Empetrum</em> spp. and grasses (Kear 2005a). <em>Non-breeding</em> In its wintering areas the species is more reliant on grass, grain, vegetables (e.g. carrots, sugar beet (Kear 2005a)) and potatoes grown on agricultural land (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a low mound of vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a) on cliffs, rocky outcrops or snow-free hummocks (Kear 2005a) often near seabird colonies (Kear 2005a). The species nests in territorial pairs (Madge and Burn 1988) which may from loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) of not more than c.10 pairs, with neighbouring nests spaced as little as 5 m apart (usually more than 75 m apart) (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information </strong>An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on grasslands a minimum of 6 ha in area, managed by livestock grazing or mechanical cutting, with an optimum sward height of 13-20 cm (although the species was also found to use heavily grazed land down to a sward height to 1.5 cm), at a distance of less than 10 km away from roosting sites (the optimum distance was 2-5 km away) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Fertilising the grassland with nitrogenous fertiliser (ammonium nitrate 34.5 % N) in early-March at a rate of 80 kg N ha<sup>1</sup> was also found to double the grazing intensity of geese compared to unfertilised areas (although no further increases were found with higher rates of fertiliser application) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Studies in the Vejlerne nature reserve, Denmark found that wind turbines placed in lines or small clusters cause less disturbance to the species than large clusters (small clusters may be placed in conjunction with existing physical elements such as roads, wind-breaks or buildings, and are therefore less likely to coincide with grasslands areas used for grazing by the species) (Larsen and Madsen 2000).","The species is hunted illegally in the spring in Iceland which may become a threat (Kear 2005a). Disturbance from hunting on spring staging grounds in Norway has major negative impact on breeding success, and persecution (shooting and disturbance) of the species by farmers is likely to increase in the future if populations increase (due to the species's impact on agricultural grassland) (Kear 2005a). Disturbance from farmers discouraging foraging individuals from their land in the winter has been shown to reduce the species's reproductive success in the spring (Madsen 1995), and the species is also threatened by general disturbance (e.g. from helicopters surveying areas for oil exploration) (Mosbech and Glahder 1991). It may be threatened by land-management changes (such as a reduction in the intensity of management and land abandonment) (Tombre <em>et al</em>. 2005), and by future habitat loss such as the development of hydroelectric projects on interior rivers in Iceland (which would flood a major moulting area) (Kear 2005a). The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of arctic fox <em>Vulpes</em> <em>lagopus</em> predation (Madsen <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is subject to hunting in Svalbard, Norway and Denmark, although mortality due to hunting does not seem to be a major factor controlling population sizes (O'Connell <em>et al</em>. 2006).","The global population is estimated at c. 410,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 57,000-74,000 pairs, which equates to 114,000-148,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex II.

Recent population increases are most likely due to the protection of sites, changed behaviour (birds using inland roosting sites such as reservoirs), improved food supplies and a reduction of hunting. Although the species is considered legitimate quarry in all European range states, special restrictions are in force throughout, for example in Denmark goose shooting is only permitted in the early morning during a short autumn season and recreational hunting in spring is banned everywhere (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).

Research in Norway has suggested the current compensation scheme can be made ten times more efficient through strategic prioritization. Careful management in important areas is needed to maintain the current population. In the UK, one study suggested that the manipulation of sward height and fertiliser application provides suitable habitat for this and other species of geese (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Hunting should be monitored and sustainable hunting levels ensured where hunting is in practice.

Males and non-breeders moult and become flightless for four weeks between June and August (females moulting one month later) (Scott and Rose 1996) prior to which they may make extensive moult migrations which take them considerable distances from the breeding waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Once this post-breeding moult is complete the species departs for its winter quarters, arriving there from October onwards (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious for most of the year (Snow and Perrins 1998) and although it is more commonly found in small groups (Madge and Burn 1988) it often forms large concentrations (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996) of several hundred individuals (Scott and Rose 1996) in moulting and wintering areas (Madge and Burn 1988). It feeds diurnally, being most active during the early morning and evening (Kear2005b). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits inland deep fresh or brackish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) reed-fringed lakes, rivers, or saline and alkaline lagoons (Kear2005b) in open country (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), also occurring (less often) on estuaries, river deltas and other sheltered coastal habitats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) on passage (Madge and Burn 1988) or during the winter (Scott and Rose 1996). <strong>Diet</strong> The diet of this species consists predominantly of the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. <em>Chara</em> spp. (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), <em>Hippurus</em> spp., hornworts <em>Ceratophyllum</em> spp., pondweeds <em>Potamogeton</em> spp., milfoil <em>Myriophyllum</em> spp. (Johnsgard 1978) and especially stonewort <em>Nitellopsis obtusa</em> (Ruiters <em>et al.</em> 1994)), although it will occasionally also take aquatic invertebrates (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. molluscs) (Johnsgard 1978), amphibians and small fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of roots, twigs and leaves near water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear2005b) on the ground in dense vegetation or on floating mats of vegetation amidst reedbeds (Johnsgard 1978). Although the species usually breeds well-dispersed, neighbouring pairs may sometimes nest as close as 30 m apart (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear2005b). <strong>Management information </strong>A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg ha<sup>1</sup>, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp or other herbivorous fish species), and systems that include ponds with fish fry are more likely to have high abundances of aquatic vegetation and are therefore more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006).","The two main threats to this species are habitat degradation (Defos du Rau 2002) (e.g. through land-use changes) (Kear2005b) and hunting (Kear2005b) (e.g. the species is hunted in France, Portugal and Spain without any official hunting bag monitoring (Defos du Rau 2002)). The species also suffers poisoning from lead shot ingestion (Spain) (Mateo <em>et al.</em> 1998)and is occasionally drowned in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm (China) (Quan <em>et al.</em> 2002). Deterioration in the water quality of wetlands can reduce the abundance of stonewort <em>Nitellopsis obtusa</em> (which is an important part of the species's diet) (Ruiters <em>et al.</em> 1994), and it is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted recreationally and for commercial purposes in Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).","The global population is estimated at 420,000-600,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 27,500-43,000 pairs, which equates to 55,100-86,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II.

Migratory populations arrive on their breeding grounds from late-April (Kear 2005a) where they breed in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) with hundreds often nesting at the same site (although not colonially) (Kear 2005a). Once incubation has commenced (Madge and Burn 1988) the males gather in flocks (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) to moult (moult migrations occurring in some areas) between late-June and early-September when they become flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996) (females moult their flight feather 1-2 months later) (Scott and Rose 1996). The autumn migration begins in September (Kear 2005a), with a segregation of the sexes occurring in autumn and winter due to the difference in the timing of the moult (Scott and Rose 1996). The return spring migration begins in late-February (Kear 2005a). During the winter the species is highly gregarious and may occur in flocks of several thousand individuals (Kear 2005a). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in lowland regions and shows a preference for eutrophic waters 3-5 m deep (avoiding lakes deeper than 15 m) (Kear 2005a) with open water, islands for breeding (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and abundant marginal and emergent vegetation (Kear 2005a). It is common on large, freshwater lakes, ponds, reservoirs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a), gravel-pits (Kear 2005a) and quiet stretches (Kear 2005a) of wide slow-flowing rivers during this season (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a). <em>Non-breeding</em> During the winter the species frequents large freshwater lakes (Kear 2005a), reservoirs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and sheltered coastal locations (Kear 2005a) such as brackish lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), brackish inland seas (Kear 2005a) (e.g. Caspian Sea) (Scott and Rose 1996), tidal bays (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998) although it avoids strong wave action and very exposed maritime conditions unless all inland freshwaters become frozen (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005a) a major part of its diet consisting of molluscs (especially <em>Mytillus</em> and <em>Cardium</em> spp., gastropods (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and zebra mussels <em>Dreissena</em> <em>polymorph</em> (Kear 2005a)), crustaceans and aquatic insects (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), as well as grain (Kear 2005a) and the seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is constructed of vegetation and is placed in water (Kear 2005a) on floating mats or islets (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), or on the ground on islands (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) in rush or grass tussocks (Snow and Perrins 1998), under bushes (Kear 2005a) or in the open amidst marsh-nesting gull or tern colonies (for protection against predators) (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a). Nests are usually placed within 20 m of water (Kear 2005a) although on islands they may be placed up to 150 m away (Snow and Perrins 1998). Although the species is not colonial hundreds may nest on the same site with neighbouring nests spaced 7-11 m apart (within gull or tern colonies nests are spaced 2-3 m apart) (Kear 2005a). <strong>Management information</strong> In the UK (Salford docks, Manchester) the species prefers to feed in waters heavily polluted with sewage that are devoid of aquatic vegetation but hold high densities of oligocheates and other pollution-tolerant organisms (Marsden and Bellamy 2000). The species may therefore suffer from plans to improve water quality in the docks (e.g. modernising sewage treatment systems and oxygenating water) (Marsden and Bellamy 2000). Experimental removal (extermination) of the nest predator American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> in the outer archipelago of south-west Finland also resulted in an increase in the breeding density of this species (Nordstrom <em>et al.</em> 2002).<strong> </strong>The species competes for food (e.g. chironomid larvae and molluscs) with fish species such as roach <em>Rutilus rutilus</em> (Winfield and Winfield 1994). A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg ha<sup>1</sup>, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK resulted in an increase in invertebrate food availability and increases in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes, which in turn led to a increase in brood use of the habitat by the species and increased species survival (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).","The species is threatened by habitat degradation due to oil pollution, drainage, peat-extraction and changing land management practices (Grishanov 2006) (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth (Grishanov 2006) and agricultural intensification (Kear 2005a)) in breeding areas (Kear 2005a, Grishanov 2006). It also suffers decreased reproductive success as a result of disturbance from increased recreational use of inland waterbodies (Kear 2005a), machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000), hunting (Evans and Day 2002) and predation by American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> on islands (Nordstrom <em>et al.</em> 2002).

It migrates on a broad front, the autumn migration beginning in late July and peaking in August or early September (in Europe and Egypt), with birds beginning to arrive in East and West Africa in early September, peaking in October (Scott and Rose 1996). Once the species reaches Africa it migrates in relation to seasonal flooding, the central point of its occurrence shifting gradually along the course of rivers as the winter progresses (Alerstam 1990). The spring migration begins in February, with birds beginning to arrive on breeding grounds from mid-March to early-May (Scott and Rose 1996). It is a highly sociable and gregarious species (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988), and whilst breeding can be found in single pairs or small groups, but regularly forms large congregations of several hundred on passage, and flocks of up to several thousand are common in African and Asiatic winter quarters (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Adults undergo a post-breeding moult period that leaves them flightless for 3-4 weeks, with males moulting between mid-July and mid-August, and females between mid-August and September (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005b). The Volga Delta, in particular, is a major moulting area for this species. Birds of this species are both diurnal and nocturnal feeders, and when migrating often travel by night and rest on open water during the day (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>In the breeding season this species frequents small, shallow ponds and lakes with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992) (that is not too tall or dense, such as bulrush - <em>Typha spp.</em>) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Green 1998), in grass dominated environments, like swampy meadows, flooded fields, shallow freshwater marshes (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992, Schricke 2001).<em> Non-breeding</em> During this season the species shows a preference for large freshwater or occasionally brackish lakes, again with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Kear 2005b), also shallow flood plains, shallow dams, pans and sewage ponds (in South Africa) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species also frequents coastal saltmarshes and lagoons on passage (de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992) and may spend the day resting on marine inshore waters when migrating (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> When breeding this species is omnivorous (Johnsgard 1978). In spring and summer its diet is dominated by animal matter: chiefly molluscs, aquatic insects and their larvae (waterbugs, caddisfly, waterbeetles, midges), crustaceans (ostracods and phyllopods especially), worms, leeches, young and spawn of frogs, and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). Seeds, roots, tubers, stems, leaves and buds of plants such as Hornwort <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, Naiad <em>Najas</em>, sedge, grass and other aquatic plants are also important at this time (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> During this season the birds are mainly vegetarian, with a diet dominated by the seeds of pondweeds, smartweeds <em>Polygonum</em>, sedges, dock <em>Rumex</em>, wild rice and grass (Kear 2005b), (with the seeds of <em>Echinochloa colona</em>, <em> Nymphea micranthia</em> and <em> Nymphea lotus</em> being the most preferred food items) (Treca 1981). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Meadows are the favoured nesting areas of this species, with nests rarely located more than 150 m from water (usually within 20 m) (Cramp and Simmons 1977). The nest itself is a depression in the ground, typically situated under rushes or tall grasses (such as manna grass, <em>Glyceria</em>), but not generally under shrubs (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992). <strong></strong>","<em>Breeding</em> The most significant threat encountered by this species on its breeding grounds in Europe is habitat deterioration through the drainage and reclamation of wetlands (Kear 2005b), the increasing climatic aridity and subsequent lowering of the water table, and the transformation of wetlands to dammed reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996).  Other threats to this species include the destruction of nests during the early mowing of meadows (Kear 2005b), increased human disturbance (Kear 2005b), lead poisoning, botulism during hot summers (Kear 2005b) and hunting disturbance in Africa and Europe (Vaananen 2001) (&gt; 500,000 are shot annually in Russia, Ukraine, France and Poland) (Kear 2005b). The invasive species American Mink <em>Mustela vison</em> also poses a threat through nest predation (Opermanis <em>et al.</em> 2001), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza (particularly strain H5N1) so is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).<em> Non-breeding</em> On its wintering grounds in Nigeria and Senegal the species is threatened by habitat destruction through dam construction, vegetation overgrowth and desertification (del Hoyo&#160;1992, Polet 2000, Triplett and Yesou 2000), and in West Africa it is threatened by large-scale river diversion and irrigation schemes (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also at risk from avian influenza in its African wintering grounds (Gaidet <em>et al.</em> 2007) as well as in its breeding areas (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The proportion of the species which migrates via the West Siberian flyway is susceptible to West Nile Virus, and is therefore threatened by future outbreaks (Ternovoi <em>et al.</em> 2004). <strong>Utilisation</strong> This species is hunted in Denmark , but there is evidence that this may be sustainable (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006). The species is also hunted for commercial and recreational purposes in Gilan Province, northern Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).","The global   population is estimated to number c.2,600,000-2,800,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 352,000-524,000 pairs, which equates to 704,000-1,050,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong>The following information refers to the species's European range only: Key areas of breeding habitat for this species should be identified and protected.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is strongly migratory in the north of its range (Kear 2005b) although breeding populations in temperate regions are largely sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Males leave the breeding grounds in early-July (one month before the females and young), migrating to key waters to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for c.4 weeks, after which they continue to the wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). The return migration occurs from March to April (Scott and Rose 1996), and although the timing of the breeding season varies geographically the species generally nests late in the year (e.g. May-July) (Kear 2005b). It breeds in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and is usually observed in small parties outside of the breeding season, with large concentrations sometimes forming on passage (Madge and Burn 1988) or during the moulting period (Kear 2005b)  (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits highly productive (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005b) and eutrophic (Snow and Perrins 1998) freshwater marsh or lake habitats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005b) in open lowland grassland (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988), showing a preference for sheltered, shallow, standing or slow-flowing waters (Snow and Perrins 1998) with abundant emergent vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005b) and grass-covered islands providing cover for nesting (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also be found on permanent, shallow, slightly alkaline marshes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), as well as on oxbow lakes, channels (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), reservoirs and gravel-pits (Kear 2005b). After hatching, females move their broods to deeper marshes or to the edges of large impoundments, sometimes more than 1 mile away from the nesting sites (Johnsgard 1978). Rarely (e.g. in the winter) (Madge and Burn 1988) the species occurs along sheltered coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996) at coastal marshes (North America) (Kear 2005b), estuaries (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), deltas or lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is predominantly herbivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), its diet consisting of the seeds, leaves, roots and stems of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (submerged and emergent) as well as grasses and stoneworts <em>Chara</em> spp. (Kear 2005b), occasionally also taking cereal grains on land (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). In addition, the species may take a small amount of animal matter during the winter (Africa), such as insects, molluscs, annelids, amphibians, amphibian spawn and small fish (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a well-hidden (Johnsgard 1978) hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) in grass and leaves positioned on the ground in thick vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as nettles <em>Urtica</em> spp. (Madge and Burn 1988), grass tussocks, thick bushes, rushes or tall grass (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species shows a preference for dense, dry herbaceous vegetation (Johnsgard 1978) and often nests far from water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). It may nest in dense concentrations on islands (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b) (neighbouring nests as close as 5 m apart) (Snow and Perrins 1998) although it is not a colonial species (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). <strong>Management information</strong> The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK (leaving small fish for piscivorous birds) resulted in an increase in the winter use of the habitat by the species as result of an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).  <p></p>","The species is threatened by pollution (Kear 2005b) and disturbance from recreational use of freshwater wetlands (Kear 2005b, Pease <em>et al.</em> 2005). It also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Spain) (Mondain-Monval <em>et al.</em> 2002) and nest predation by American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> (Europe) (Opermanis <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Melville and Shortridge 2006). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted throughout most of its range (Kear 2005b) both for recreation (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006, Shortridge <em>et al.</em> 2006) and commercial uses (Balmaki and Barati 2006), but is rarely taken in large numbers except where it is particularly abundant (Kear 2005b).

It will gather in large concentrations on fruiting trees, plucking berries from the tree but also feeding on the ground. Breeding occurs in January-September. It makes some altitudinal movements to take advantage of ripe cereals and fruit at lower elevations in late summer. <p></p>","Historical declines resulted from intensive exploitation of laurel forests. The extent of forest loss has slowed, although fragmentation has continued in some areas as forests are exploited for poles and tool handles.

A significant part of its potential distribution range, mostly at windward areas, is currently dominated by exotic species such as <em>Opuntia</em> sp. and <em>Agave americana</em>.","Agriculture has been reported as a threat to this species in Madeira in the past, as its expansion removed the available habitat. Agricultural lands have since been abandoned and the range of the species has expanded. However, agriculture may expand in the future. Invasive species such as&#160;<em>Acacia </em>sp., <em>Cardiospermum</em> sp.<em> </em>and&#160;<em>Arundo</em> sp. are colonising areas before&#160;<em>Globularia </em>sp. can establish. These invasives also increase the risk of fires.<br/><br/>In the Canary Islands changes of land use to agricultural land were identified as a threat to the species in the past.

The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is a Palearctic migrant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) that travels with the assistance of thermal updrafts, the occurrence of which restricts the migratory routes the species can take (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). For example the species must avoid long stretches of open water such as the Mediterranean Sea and must therefore bypass it on narrow fronts to the west or east (Snow and Perrins 1998, Van den Bossche 2002), after which it crosses the Sahara on a broad front (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Once within Africa the species becomes considerably nomadic in response to changing abundances of food (e.g. locust swarms) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds from February to April in the Palearctic, whilst the tiny breeding population in South Africa breeds from September to November (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It nests in loose colonies of up to 30 pairs (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or solitarily (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The main departure from the European breeding grounds occurs in August (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) with the species travelling in large flocks (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) of many thousands of individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998), generally arriving in Africa by early-October (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). It forages singly, in small groups of 10-50 individuals (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005), or in large flocks if prey is abundant and on its wintering grounds it may gather in large numbers (hundreds or thousands of individuals) at abundant food sources (e.g. locust swarms or grass fires) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species feeds diurnally (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) and roosts communally at night in trees (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits open areas, generally avoiding regions with persistent cold, wet weather or large tracts of tall, dense vegetation such as reedbeds or forests (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), shallow marshes, lakesides (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), flood-plains, rice-fields and arable land (Snow and Perrins 1998) especially where there are scattered trees for roosting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> During the winter the species shows a preference for drier habitats (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as grasslands, steppe, savanna and cultivated fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), often gathering near lakes, ponds (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), pools, slow-flowing streams, ditches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or rivers (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is carnivorous and has a varied and opportunistic diet (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It takes small mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. voles, water voles, mice, shrews, young rats (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992)), large insects (e.g. beetles, grasshoppers, crickets and locusts), adult and juvenile amphibians, snakes, lizards, earthworms, fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), eggs and nestlings of ground-nesting birds, molluscs and crustaceans (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of sticks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and is commonly positioned up to 30 m above the ground (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) in trees or on the roofs of buildings, as well as on pylons, telegraph poles, stacks of straw and other anthropogenic sites (including specially erected nesting structures), cliffs and occasionally among rushes on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species nests solitarily or in loose colonies, often using traditional nesting sites (there are records of individual nests being used every year for 100 years) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Nesting sites are usually situated near foraging areas, but may be up to 2-3 km away (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information</strong> Intensively grazed (&gt; 1 cow per hectare) unfertilised grassland was found to attract a higher abundance of this species in Hungary (Baldi <em>et al.</em> 2005), and traditional livestock-farming practices such as creating herb-rich meadows for stock grazing and hay production are thought to be beneficial (Goriup and Schulz 1990). A model used to study the impact of different land use patterns on the species found that sequential (asynchronous) mowing of grasslands may increase the food supply for nestlings, thereby increasing reproductive success (as sequential mowing generates a small number of high-quality foraging patches throughout the breeding season) (Johst <em>et al.</em> 2001). A report by the International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP) suggests that habitat management for the species should include the periodic flooding of meadows, the creation of a mosaic of native grasslands and meadows, and the retention or creation of ditches, ponds and lakes (Goriup and Schulz 1990). The report also advises management strategies in relation to electricity pylons (e.g. burying or marking aerial cables and preventing disturbance to nests during maintenance) to reduce the threats of electrocution and collision (Goriup and Schulz 1990). Due to the species's habit of defecating on its legs to regulate its body temperature in hot climates it is inadvisable to fit individuals with leg-rings for tracking purposes (dry uric acid builds-up on the legs and hardens around leg-rings, tightening them and leading to injuries) (Goriup and Schulz 1990). Other methods of monitoring movements such as satellite telemetry or patagial wing-tags are therefore advised (Goriup and Schulz 1990).","The species is threatened by habitat alteration including the drainage of wet meadows (Goriup and Schulz 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), prevention of floods on flood-plains (by dams, embankments, pumping stations and river canalisation schemes) (Goriup and Schulz 1990), conversion of foraging areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), development, industrialisation and intensification of agriculture (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. mechanised ploughing of rough pastures to sow fertilised crops or swards of more productive grass varieties) (Goriup and Schulz 1990). It is also threatened by a shortage of nesting sites in some areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) as, for example, the roofs of new rural buildings do not support nests and nest structures on pylons are frequently destroyed during maintenance work (Goriup and Schulz 1990). During the winter in Africa there may be high rates of mortality due to changes in feeding conditions owing to drought, desertification and the control of locust populations by insecticides (Goriup and Schulz 1990, Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species may also suffer as a result of the excessive use of pesticides (e.g. in Africa) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) and through eating poisoned baits put out to catch large carnivores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Another serious threat is collision with and electrocution from overhead powerlines (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), especially whilst on migration in Europe (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is hunted for food and sport (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), mainly on migration (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) and in its winter quarters (Goriup and Schulz 1990).","The global population size is estimated at 700,000-704,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 224,000-247,000 pairs, which equates to 447,000-495,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>This species is listed  on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention  and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is  covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Populations breeding on the Atlantic coast of Europe, in the Mediterranean and in South Africa are largely sedentary due to the relatively mild winters (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996) (although they may make local dispersive movements related to rainfall) (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). Continental populations are mainly migratory however (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) with a marked post-breeding dispersal of immatures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds from March to June in Eurasia and during the rains from September to January in South Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It usually nests solitarily although males are polygamous and may mate with up to five females nesting on a large wetland site (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species remains solitary throughout the year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (although migratory individuals may travel in small flocks) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and is mainly crepuscular in its activities (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species has highly restrictive breeding habitat requirements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It shows a strong preference for quiet lowland marshes around lakes and rivers (less than 200 m above sea-level) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) with extensive dense young reedbeds of <em>Phragmites</em> spp. (e.g. with 1- 3 years worth of new growth (Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000, Puglisi <em>et al.</em> 2005) but still maintaining some old or dead stems (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)) that are flooded but are fairly shallow (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (less than 30 cm deep) (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996), have few fluctuations in water-level (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), have low acidity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005)and are surrounded by clear open areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of deeper water is maintained into the driest part of the breeding season (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2005). Breeding adults are more attracted to unfragmented (Puglisi <em>et al.</em> 2005) reedbeds over 20 ha in area, although smaller sites with networks of reed-fringed waterways or open wetland habitats with a number of small reedbeds (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996) (greater than 100 m) (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2005) over a wide area may also be used (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species avoids saline waters (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) but is equally abundant in fresh or brackish habitats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. in estuarine or delta marshes) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and may occasionally nest in stands of rushes <em>Scirpus</em> spp. (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or <em>Papyrus</em> spp. if reeds are unavailable (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species frequents a more varied range of habitats outside of breeding season, foraging on rice-fields, watercress beds, gravel pits, fish farms, ditches, sewage farms (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), small ponds and wet grassy areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) as well as marshes and reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It also forages in running water (e.g. streams) when still waterbodies freeze during the winter (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet varies depending on the site and season although it predominantly takes fish (particularly cyprinids and eels) and amphibians as well as adult and larval insects, spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, snakes, lizards, birds, nestlings and small mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a pad of reeds and other vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) constructed close to or floating on water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) amidst dense reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Although it is a solitary nester, breeding densities from 2 per 100 ha to 100 per 100 ha may occur depending on the quality of the habitat (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), nests sometimes being placed close together in areas where the species is particularly numerous (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). <strong>Management information</strong> Breeding adults in Europe may be more attracted to unfragmented (Puglisi <em>et al.</em> 2005) reedbeds over 20 ha in area, although smaller sites with networks of reed-fringed waterways or open wetland habitats with a number of small reedbeds over a wide area may also be used (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996). There is evidence that females in Britain preferentially nest in locations surrounded by less scrub but more vegetated open water, with a higher proportion of <em>Phragmites</em> spp. than other plant species, and in areas where deeper water is maintained into the driest part of the breeding season (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2005). The European Action Plan for this species recommends raising water levels, harvesting and burning reeds, cutting invasive scrub, or digging out reedbeds on a rotational compartmental basis as methods of slowing reedbed succession (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996). It also recommends the regular cutting of small areas of reedbed to maintain <em>Phragmites</em> spp. monocultures (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996), to provide a range of multi-age reed stands (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and to favour the retention of water levels in spring and summer (promoting rapid growth, preventing a build-up of reed litter and providing foraging sites) (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996). Large-scale reed cutting should be prohibited in the late-winter however (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Wetlands should also be managed to enhance the carrying capacity of fish and eel populations (thus increasing food resources for bitterns) (Noble <em>et al.</em> 2004, Self 2005, Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2007). In Britain it was found that suitable habitats should be provided for all fish life stages (including spawning, refuge and overwintering), the movement of fish throughout reedbeds should be promoted (e.g. by changes in hydrological management regimes and sluice design) (Noble <em>et al.</em> 2004) and issues relating to water quality, zooplankton and macrophyte community structures should be addressed (Self 2005).","The species is threatened mainly by the loss of <em>Phragmites</em> reed marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) owing to habitat alteration through drainage (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), direct destruction (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), changes in traditional management (e.g. changes to reed harvesting regimes) (Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000), sea level rise and salt water intrusion (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996), the effects of wave action from boat traffic at the edge of open water (Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000), and pollution (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000) (either eutrophication which modifies fish populations within reedbeds or pesticides which may reduce the species's survival) (Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000). Disturbance from humans during the nesting period is also a threat (Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996, Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. disturbance from reed cutting [Kushlan and Hancock 2005], noisy recreation and water-sports [Newbery <em>et al.</em> 1996, Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005], motor vehicles and hunting [Kushlan and Hancock 2005]). The hunting of adults and collecting of eggs and chicks still occurs in some areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), and the species may suffer high mortalities in very cold winters (especially in sedentary populations) (Marion <em>et al.</em> 2000).","The global   population is estimated to number c.115,000-340,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 37,600-66,400 calling or lekking males, which equates to 75,300-133,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Wollaston (1864) states that larvae are xylophagous, feeding on rotten wood, normally in the roots and basal part of trunks of different<em> Euphorbia</em> species. Kubisz and Borowski (1999) state that they found larvae and pupae in partially rotten roots of <em>E. regis-jubae</em>. Plata-Negrache and Alonso-Zarazaga (2006) describe finding larvae and pupae in an “old-age” specimen of <em>D. draco</em>, extracting them from what are clearly dead woody tissues on the inner faces of trunk cavities. The illustrations are very typical of the hollowed trunks of large old living trees and the authors do not explain why they regard the beetle as a pest nor why they describe their presence in terms of an infestation. They say that the <em>Dracaena</em> must be relatively old to have acquired a woody consistency, since all attempts carried out for gravid females to oviposit on small <em>Dracaena</em>&#160;were unsuccessful.</p><p>The first instar larvae are stated to possess mandibles not strong enough to cut healthy wood. If the substratum consistency is impaired by fungal or bacterial action they can penetrate the decayed wood more efficiently. These observations are consistent with those of Wollaston (1864) and Kubisz and Borowski (1999), and actually support the idea that the beetle species is a saproxylic. While it remains unclear whether this species is an obligate saproxylic, the current understanding of its ecology suggest that this is likely. Further research into its ecology however is desirable.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This species is found on coastal cliffs in western Europe and in high  mountain pastures with rocky crags elsewhere. Coastal populations such  as those found in Ireland, Britain, Brittany, Canaries, and north-west  Spain, favour sea cliffs with rocky crags, interspersed with closely  grazed grassland. Inland populations occur in high  mountain pastures above the tree-line, favouring sheep-grazed slopes and farther east, associated with grazing yaks (<em>Bos grunniens</em>) and ponies.  The species is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond (Madge 2009). Egg-laying  begins in March in Britain and late April to May in western China and the Caucasus  (Madge 2009). The nest is a mass of sticks, thickly lined with  wool, rarely all wool and built typically in the roof of a cave, rock  chimney, or disused quarry, but also uses roof spaces of disused  buildings, old mine shafts or similar sites. Clutches are usually four  eggs. It is chiefly insectivorous, particulary in spring and summer, but  also feeds on a wide variety of other invertebrates and rarely on small  vertebrates such as lizards (Lacertidae) and small mammals. In autumn  and winter, when invertebrate food more difficult to find, it takes  grain, seeds and small berries, including those of rowan (<em>Sorbus</em>), pear  (<em>Pyrus</em>), juniper (<em>Juniperus</em>), sea-buckthorn (<em>Hippophae</em>) and olive  (<em>Olea</em>). The species is essentially sedentary (Madge 2009).","The most important cause of declines in the species is changes in  grazing regimes (Madge 2009) and conversion of grazing habitat to  forestry, tourist-related developments or intensive farming (Batten <em>et al</em>. 1989, Tucker and  Heath 1994). Historically, grazing animals roamed freely over mountain  slopes and coastal cliffs, keeping vegetation short and ideal for  invertebrates (Madge 2009). In the Alps, it is thought competition with  Alpine Chough (<em>Pyrrhocorax graculus</em>) and Eurasian Jackdaw (<em>Corvus  monedula</em>) may be detrimental to the species (Madge and Burn 1993). The  species has also suffered from persecution (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997)  and they were shot for sport during the 19th and 20th centuries (Wilmore  1977).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 40,500-86,400 pairs, which equates to 80,900-173,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms c.10% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 809,000-1,730,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

It lives in forests of laurel and pine&#160;trees between 500 m and 1,300 m asl. It prefers shady and moist situations, and feeds on various kind of decayed wood and woody debris. This species is assessed as Near Threatened since it is very localised but common where present, it has a restricted geographic range (extent of occurrence (EOO) is 1,070 km² and area of occupancy (AOO) &#160;is 200 km²), and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat due to deforestation and forestry.

The biology was described by Demelt (1971) and then by Palm (1977), while the larva was described by Švácha and Danilevsky (1989). The species inhabits shady, cool and moist sites like the Mercedes Forest at 700-800 m Asl and Aguamansa at 1,000-1,100 m asl. The larva lives mostly in the old, rotten stumps and stems (sometimes in dead roots) of<em> Laurus canariensis</em> in contact with the ground. <em>Pinus canariensis</em>, <em>Erica arborea</em>, <em>Myrica faya</em> and <em>Eucalyptus</em> sp.<em>&#160;</em>have also been reported to host larvae (Palm 1977). The stems often have a diameter of 35-40 cm (<em>Laurus</em>) or 15-20 cm (<em>Pinus</em>), are usually protected externally by a hard wooden shell, while the inside is heavily decayed. The larvae are found at the border between the hard and the rotten wood, where they make irregular tunnels, clogged with woody debris. Many generations live in the same log and larval development takes two or more years. In mid-May, the larvae pupate in the harder wood layers, near the outer wall. In nature, the hatching of adults should occurs from late June to late July. Adults are not reported from flowers.","This species is potentially threatened by human activities that reduce the forest extent: deforestation for agriculture, infrastructure construction and forest exploitation.

Presence and absence records are derived from recent, extensive surveys carried out between 2004 and 2009 (Elliot 2009, B. Rumeu unpublished data 2010, Sequeira pers. comm. 2010). The total population (n = <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ca </span>600) consists of five subpopulations/ locations found on five islands (Gran Canaria (n =12), Gomera (n = 100), La Palma (n = 250), Tenerife (n = 200) and Madeira (n = <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ca</span> 40)). Each subpopulation/location is more than 60 km from the next and no single subpopulation contains more than 50% of the total population. These subpopulations are regarded as severely fragmented. The total population is estimated to be less than 600 mature trees and no subpopulation contains more than 250 mature individuals. Regeneration in some subpopulations is poor or absent, possibly due to reduced seed set (Rumeu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009), the decline of avian dispersers (Nogales 1999, Rumeu 2009) and the effects of grazing. In some locations fires have led to the loss of mature individuals. Together, these factors contribute to a continuing decline in the quality of&#160; habitat and number of mature individuals. On the basis of these data, <em>Juniperus cedrus</em> meets the criteria for Endangered.</p>","<p><u>Canary Islands</u><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>In the Canary Islands this species has become adapted to different habitats. In Tenerife and La Palma, <em>J. cedrus</em> occurs at the timberline (2,200 m), which characteristically has low precipitation and great diurnal temperature variation. Here the dominant vegetation is of shrubs <em>Spartocytisus supranubius</em> and <em>Adenocarpus viscosus</em>. In contrast, on La Gomera, which is lower in altitude, (1,150 m.) the habitat is Laurel forest which has high levels of humidity as a result of the north-east trade winds. In Gran Canaria it only occurs on Montaña del Cedro, where it grows at altitudes between 800-900 m, here the temperatures are relatively warmer. At some of the locations (La Gomera and one location on Tenerife) there is evidence of regeneration but generally recruitment appears to be relatively poor. One factor that may be related to this, is the decline in ravens (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Corvus corax</span>) that are thought to have played a significant role in seed dispersal (Nogales 1999, Rumeu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Recent research has revealed that winter visiting Ring Ouzels (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Turdus torquatus)</span> also play a key role in seed dispersal (Rumeu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Additional research has indicated that the Canary Islands subpopulations produce seed with relatively lower viability, possibly due to lower pollination rates resulting from fragmentation of stands (Rumeu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/></p><p><u>Madeira</u></p>  The subpopulation on Madeira occurs on exposed rock faces above the laurel forest tree-line above 1,400 m in altitude. Here it belongs to the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Polysticho falcinelli-Ericetum arboreae</span> (Capelo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). The main components include: <em>Erica maderinicola, Ilex perado, Laurus novocanariensis, Polystichum falcinellum, Vaccinium padifolium</em> &amp; <em>Sorbus maderensis</em>. In Madeira there have not been any studies to establish whether or not there is any regeneration, however since the removal of goats in recent years the vegetation recovery rates are very encouraging. <br/> <br/> The current distribution pattern and the restriction to almost inaccessible sites in the Canary Islands and on Madeira reflect past human disturbance. Formerly it was more widespread.","<p><u>Canary Islands</u><u></u></p>  <p>There are a variety of threats, the most severe of which is fire. In 2007 a fire on Tenerife (El Teide National Park) destroyed 30 old-growth trees. Other threats, which are detrimental to recruitment, include goats and the release of Barbary sheep (La Palma) and Muflón (Tenerife) for hunting purposes. Global warming could affect the amount of seasonal rainfall and moisture from coastal fog. </p>  <p><u>Madeira</u><u></u></p>  <p>Historically over-grazing, cutting and burning have been significant threats to the population. Although these threats are less today, the fast expansion of <em>Cytisus scoparius</em> following grazing is certainly a potential threat as it greatly increases the fire risks. </p>","<p>The population is estimated to be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">c</span>.600 sexually mature individuals.</p>  <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Canary Islands</span> - 572 individuals: Gran Canaria 12; La Palma 250; Tenerife 200; La Gomera 100 (Elliot 2009).</p>  <u>Madeira</u>&#160;- one population with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">c</span>.40 individuals (Sequeira pers. comm. 2010, unpublished data).",Decreasing,"<p>Restricted to the Canary Islands (Gran Canaria, Gomera, La Palma and Tenerife)  and Madeira (from Pico Arieiro to Pico Ruivo) (Silva and Menezes 1946, Rivas-Martínez<em> et al. </em>2002, Borges <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>","<p><u>Canary  Islands</u><u></u></p>  <p>Historically the wood was exploited for its valuable, aromatic timber, and used by local people in carpentry for a various items of furniture, construction and for making boxes because of the wood's capacity to deter insect pests (Vieira 2002).

It also uses larch (<em>Larix</em>), cedar (<em>Cedrus</em>), alder (<em>Alnus</em>) and birch (<em>Betula</em>). In North America it also uses hemlock (<em>Tsuga</em>) and Douglas-fir (<em>Pseudotsuga</em>). In North Africa it breeds mostly in Aleppo pine (<em>Pinus halepensis</em>),&#160;less commonly in maritime pine (<em>Pinus pinaster</em>), almond (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>), walnut (<em>Juglans</em>), poplar (<em>Populus</em>), hornbeam (<em>Carpinus</em>), beech (<em>Fagus</em>), oak (<em>Quercus</em>) and hazel (<em>Corylus</em>). In the Himalayas it is mostly found in high-altitude hemlocks, spruce, fir (<em>Abies</em>) and pine forests. On passage and in the non-breeding season it occurs in pine and deciduous trees in coastal woodlands, parks and gardens, including in suburban areas and city centres, also exceptionally along tideline.&#160;<br/>The breeding season is generally determined by food abundance but is typically from August to April/May in northern and central Europe, mid-January to mid-May in Scandinavia, February to mid-May in northern Russia, March to early November in Cyprus and December-January in the Philippines. It breeds at any time of year in the Indian Subcontinent and in most months in North America. The nest is a deep cup of conifer twigs, bark or rotting wood strips, plant fibres, grass, moss, lichens, animal hair and feathers. It is sited 3–35 m above the ground, usually beneath the outermost foliage, close to the crown of a tall conifer and often close to the trunk in a spruce or along the branch of a pine. Clutches are three to four eggs. The species is resident and a partial migrant and is commonly irruptive and nomadic in the non-breeding season (Clement and Christie 2016).","In Finland, the species has declined due to forest fragmentation. This is principally as a result of overall shortening of rotation times leading to a reduction in the average age of forests. In Canada and the USA, increased logging of old-growth habitats may depress populations because conifers produce their largest cone crops after about 60 years of age. The population in Newfoundland has undergone a steady decline over the last 50 years possibly owing to competition for cone crops from introduced American red squirrels (<em>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</em>) and accelerated logging of old-growth woods (Clement and Christie 2016).","Rich <em>et al</em>.

In the northern part of its range it occurs mainly in cultivated land, preferring low-intensity, mixed farmland on light soils, with sparsely vegetated spots and scattered or lines of trees or bushes. In forested areas of Fenno-Scandinavia and Russia, it occupies forest margins, clearings and clear fells. In the southern areas of its breeding range it occurs in rugged open mountainous areas with some shrubs up to 2,400 m asl (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Madge and Sharpe 2016). Eggs are laid from mid-April until early June. The nest is built by the female, often on the ground in a field of growing crops. The clutch consists of four or five eggs. The chicks hatch after 11–12 days, are tended by both parents and leave the nest after another 12–13 days. Autumn migration usually takes place from mid-August to mid-September (Madge and Sharpe 2016). During the breeding season the species mainly feeds on small invertebrates such as ants, beetles and grasshoppers, both on the ground and in bushes or the canopy of trees. Outside the breeding season it mainly forages on seeds. The species is migratory, wintering in the northern part of sub-Saharan Africa (Madge and Sharpe 2016).","The main pressure affecting populations of the species in Europe is the replacement of small-scale mixed farming by large-scale agricultural intensification, including the use of insecticides and herbicides. A reduction in bare patches for foraging and a lack of invertebrate-rich grassland at nesting areas appears to have significant impacts on the species (Menz and Arlettaz 2012). Ongoing conversion of relatively extensively used habitat to crop fields for biofuel is another issue.

Farther south it occupies scrubby woodland, undergrowth-free orchards, edges of wadis, thickets, bramble and nettles. In Morocco it breeds mainly along streams in woodland, in low thickets (especially bramble) along rivers, coastal maquis, undergrowth of cork oak forest, holm oak coppice, brushwoods (<em>Tetraclinis</em>, <em>Olea</em>, <em>Pistacia</em>) and orchards, in plains and on lower slopes up to 1,300 m, occasionally in cultivated valleys to 1850 m. In Afghanistan it is found up to 2,300 m in shady tangles, thickets and scrub, usually near water as well as in orchards and gardens. In the African non-breeding grounds it uses dense forest edge and secondary growth, riverine and woodland thickets, savanna scrub, farmbush, thorny scrub, rank herbage along watercourses, overgrown clearings, tall grass patches, field margins and garden hedges. It breeds from late April to mid July in Europe, May-July in Afghanistan, mid-April to June in Morocco and May in Algeria. The nest is an occasionally domed bulky cup of dead leaves and grass, lined with fine grasses, feathers and hair.

Clutches are four or five eggs. The diet is&#160; mostly insects throughout the year, especially during the breeding season, when some fruits and plant material are also taken. Through the rest of the year it is mostly frugivorous. The species is a long-distance migrant (Aymí and Gargallo 2015).",The spread of exotic&#160;<em>Reynoutria</em>&#160;spp. has been shown to reduce numbers of this species where it occurs (Hajzlerová and Reif 2014).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is strongly migratory, undertaking significant cold weather movements of varying magnitude (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It leaves its breeding grounds in late summer (September) to arrive in its wintering grounds across Europe and Asia in October and November (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Populations leave their winter quarters again between March and April, and arrive in their breeding grounds in northern Russia during the second half of May (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. Both the males and females of the species undergo a flightless moult period after breeding and whilst still in their breeding range, during which they congregate at moult gatherings (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong> (males moult their flight feathers between late May and July, females between late June and early September) (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Birds of this species are dispersive during the breeding season and nest in pairs or small groups (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. On passage to their wintering grounds individuals come together in large numbers, and during the non-breeding season the species is highly gregarious, forming close aggregations (4,200 birds were recorded in one wintering flock in Ethiopia) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is chiefly a diurnal feeder (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, but is sometimes nocturnal (depending on local disturbances and tides, especially in its non-breeding marine habitats) (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> This species breeds in lowland freshwater marshes, slow-flowing large rivers (Kretchmar 1994)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and shallow lakes and lagoons with ample submerged, floating and emerging vegetation (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Ideal wetland habitats for this species are those surrounded by sparse open forest, woodland and especially agricultural land (Kretchmar 1994, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, in the boreal and subarctic zone (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It avoids tundra, densely forested and mountainous country, as well as fast flowing rivers and streams, but tolerates saline or alkaline steppe lakes and wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>In the non-breeding season this species shows a preference for coastal salt-marshes, freshwater, brackish and saline lagoons (Cramp and Simmons 1977)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, flooded grasslands (Cramp and Simmons 1977)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, estuaries, intertidal mudflats (Cramp and Simmons 1977)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and other sheltered marine habitats (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet</strong> It  is vegetarian and consumes the leaves, seeds, stems and root bulbs of pond weeds, fine grasses (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (especially from agricultural land surrounding lakes) (Jacobsen 1993)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, horsetails (Kretchmar 1994)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and eelgrass, as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Animal material is taken rarely and usually incidentally along with vegetation or seeds (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nests of this species are shallow depressions in the ground lined with vegetation, usually positioned not far from water and well concealed under overhanging vegetation, in grass tussocks, scrub (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and especially in heather (Jacobsen and Ugelvik 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<p></p>","This species is susceptible to disturbance from freshwater recreational activities (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Grishanov 2006) (e.g. tourists walking) (Mathers <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, pollution (including thallium contamination [Mochizuki, <em>et al.</em> 2005]<strong><sup></sup></strong>, petroleum pollution [Grishanov 2006]<strong></strong>), wetland drainage (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, peat-extraction (e.g. in the Kaliningrad region of Russia) (Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) (Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

The estimated extent of occurrence is 12,705 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy is estimated at 196-250 km<sup>2</sup>. The number of locations greatly exceeds ten, the species is not considered to be severely fragmented, and the known threats are not thought to have resulted in significant population declines. As a result, the species is assessed as Least Concern, however the subspecies&#160;<em>purpuriense&#160;</em>is threatened and should be the focus of conservation actions.","This species grows as a shrub of up to 2 m. It is found growing in forest as well as on crags (Bramwell and Bramwell 1990), although&#160;Bañares <em>et al.</em> (2004) consider subsp. <em>purpuriense</em> to be primarily a rupicolous species, found on rocky shelves and cracks, often in inaccessible areas, on steep slopes, whilst a secondary habitat is in soils at the base of crags, in ravines, and in rocky areas between fields and along road edges.<br/><br/>The species is easy to multiply by cuttings and seeds (Bañares <em>et al. </em>2004) and is a component of replanting projects.","On Fuerteventura (subsp. <em>purpuriense</em>) the main threats were considered (Bañares <em>et al. </em>2004, Jaén Molina <em>et al. </em>2006) to be excessive cattle pressure, extended dry climatic cycles, tourism activities, soil erosion, and feral herbivores, whilst on Lanzarote degradation by goats was observed. However the plant is relatively resistant to browsing and the populations have coexisted with free roaming animals for 2000 years in areas where most other shrub species have been eliminated by them and the current main threat may arise from climate change and the resultant changes to trade wind and rainfall patterns (S. Scholz pers. comm. 2017). Other threats common to both islands included soil erosion during the rainy season and tourism (increase in waste volumes and increased pressure from foot trampling and traffic of vehicles). The presence of the type subspecies&#160;(<em>decaisnei</em>) on both islands may lead to future hybridization problems.","On Gran Canaria, this species is considered locally abundant and can act as a pioneer species in disturbed areas (J.A.

It generally occupies more open habitat in the south and  north portions of range where cliffs, sparse trees and human structures provide nest  locations. In middle latitudes it is generally found in coniferous and  broadleaf forests, where tree-nesting often more common than  cliff-nesting. It is abundant in temperate (coniferous) rainforest along the north Pacific coast of North America. It generally avoids large cities but is abundant in Anchorage, Alaska and locally abundant in California metropolitan areas (Marzluff 2009). Egg-laying begins in late February  over most of its range, although further north in Greenland and Siberia  it begins later in April (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a large and  bulky platform, made from dead sticks, lined with fine roots, grass,  string and other bits of rubbish, and with mammal fur to make an inner  cup. It is placed in the stout, lower branches of a tree, on a steep  cliff, or on an artificial structure such as a utility pole, building,  sign, radio tower, abandoned vehicle, oil derrick, bridge, irrigation  pipe or windmill. Clutch size is typically four to six eggs. It is an  opportunistic scavenger, consuming a huge variety of animals and plants.  It preys on adult and nestling birds, eggs, small mammals, sick and  dying larger mammals, toads, snakes, juvenile turtles, fish and  invertebrates. It also scavenges garbage and slaughterhouse offal, dung,  and nearly any kind of carrion and some plant matter is also consumed  (Marzluff 2009). The species is mostly sedentary but northern  populations are liable to move south in winter (Hagemeijer and Blair  1997).","From mid-1600s to mid-1900s or later this species was widely persecuted  due to fear and superstition, resulting in European populations being  reduced, often to point of creating gaps in the species's distribution  (e.g. throughout much northern and central Europe). Persecution still  continues in Iceland and Greenland but throughout the rest of Europe it  is much reduced, allowing the species to recolonize areas it was  previously extirpated from. Increasing populations of this species in much of western U.S.A. have led to conflict and targeted killing campaigns with large numbers shot and poisoned in California, Oregon, Utah and Nevada with limited and short-term benefits to crops and other wildlife (Marzluff 2009).

The abundance of the species varies from rare, occasional to abundant in just a few stations. The overall trend of the population size is decreasing, the number of mature individuals and the population density of <em>P. atlantica </em>are significantly reduced during the last decades due to many threats; ruthless collection for domestic uses as forage or firewood and for trade, collection practices, overgrazing, deforestation, desertification, phenomenon of silting, erosion and insects attacks.

The species can occupy rock cracks and cliffs, plains on deep or very rocky soils, stony hillsides, steep dry slopes, sandstone hills, gullies or temporarily damp depressions (Jahandiez and Maire 1932, Nègre 1962, Ozenda 1983, Benabid and Fennane 1994, Charco 2001, Benabid 2002, Rezaeyan <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<em>Pistacia atlantica</em> can grow in most soil types except sandy soil and does not require irrigation to survive. The species prefers open and sunny habitats but can be found in mid-shaded habitats; flowers from December to May and fruiting from March to September. It grows in a humid, sub-humid to sub-arid Mediterranean climates (Jahandiez and Maire 1932, Nègre 1962, Ozenda 1983, Benabid and Fennane 1994, Charco 2001, Benabid 2002, Rezaeyan <em>et al.</em> 2009).","The population size and habitats of <em>Pistacia atlantica</em> are in continuous degradation and decline due to numerous medium to high impact threats, anthropogenic and climatic effects especially: ruthless collection for domestic uses as forage or firewood and for trade, collection practices, overgrazing preventing natural regeneration and development of young shoots, deforestation, desertification, phenomenon of silting, erosion and insects attacks such us the golden causing blisters or galls in the leaves (Benabid 2002, Dahmani&#160; 2011, Taleb and Fennane 2011, Benradje <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;<em>Pistacia atlantica</em> is heavily collected by locals and collectors for firewood, domestic uses as remedy or to trade nationally (e.g. in Morocco 800-1600 Dhs/kg) and for international export (tonnes a year). The bad collection practices of the wild species are destroying the entire species and preventing it from growing again.&#160;<em>Pistacia atlantica</em>&#160;is threatened more generally by the direct and indirect impact of human activities such as leisure activities, tourism, infrastructure development, long periods of drought and climate change and the lack of management activities.","<em>Pistacia atlantica</em> is local and scattered in most of its localities. The abundance of the species varies from rare, occasional to abundant on few stations but most of the subpopulations are found as isolated trees or as small clusters of 2–3 trees. In Algeria, <em>P. atlantica</em> exists in small stands and small bouquets or as isolated individual trees scattered often outside forests. The species was widespread in Southern Algeria and in the arid regions where it associates with the<em> Juniperus phoenicea</em>, green oak and the olive trees (Belhadj 2001, Benradje<em> et al.</em> 2012).&#160;In Morocco, <em>P. atlantica</em> constituted a climax on the arid highlands of eastern Morocco.

Therefore, the population size is suspected to decline globally by a quarter (25%) over the next 100 years based on the level of exploitation of the species, the poor health of the mature individuals due to competition and attacks from insects and the significant degradation of the habitats.",Decreasing,"<em>Pistacia atlantica </em>is widespread across North Africa, Canary Islands and a section of Eurasia from the Iranian Plateau (Euro+Med 2017, WCSP 2017, GBIF 2017).<br/><br/>In North Africa,&#160;<em>P.&#160;atlantica&#160;</em>occurs in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt (Charco 2001, Dobignard and Chatelain 2011, Al-Saghir and Porter 2012, Euro+Med 2017). In Morocco, <em>P. </em><em>atlantica</em> is found in most of the major floristic divisions across the country within a range of altitude up to 1,950 m, the species is rare in the well-watered regions (Jahandiez and Maire 1932, Nègre 1962, Ozenda 1983, Charco 2001, Valdés <em>et al.</em> 2002, Fennane and Ibn Tattou 2005, Fennane <em>et al. </em>2007).

The population trend appears to be declining but it is not thought to be declining sufficiently to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

In the east it is found increasingly not only in built-up areas, but also in open arid country. In the Far East where <em>P. domesticus</em> is absent it is common in built-up areas and is even found in urban centres. In the north of its range the breeding season begins from April or May and to January in the extreme south of Asia. It breeds in loose colonies. The nest is constructed of dried grass and rootlets, lined with feathers and animal fur and is domed (even when in a hole), with as entrance on the side. It is mostly sited in a hole in a tree, earth bank, cliff or artificial structure, sometimes in the base of a large nest of heron (Ardeidae), crow (Corvidae) or bird of prey. Occasionally it is a free-standing nest in a tree, but then usually hidden in thick conifer or creepers. Clutches are two to seven eggs. The diet is mainly seeds and it prefers smaller seeds of low herbs and grasses, including cultivated cereals but it also takes a significant proportion of animal food (Summers-Smith 2016). In Europe the species is largely sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). In central Asia, the species makes more pronounced movements. Birds in the extreme north of the range withdraw to the south and those living in the countryside tend to move into built-up areas (Summers-Smith 2016).",Declines in this species in Europe may be a result of changes in agricultural practices such as the increased use of pesticides and herbicides and the autumn sowing of cereals which have lead to decreases in food for this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).,"Rich <em>et al</em>.

Grazing pressure from livestock (mainly goats) impacts seedling regeneration and juveniles. Browsing by rabbits may also impact some subpopulations. However most remaining subpopulations are in inaccessible areas, cliffs etc., where direct impacts are low. Competition with exotic plants (e.g.,&#160;<em>Opuntia maxima&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>Agave americana</em>) has also been cited as a threat (Mesa Coello&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;Hiking, trekking and climbing may impact some areas (Almeida Pérez 2011), however most remaining individuals are in inaccessible areas.&#160;In Madeira, the main threats are landslides in steep areas of the habitat and competition with exotic plants (e.g., <em>Opuntia tuna</em> and <em>Arundo donax</em>).","The wild subpopulations of the Canary Island Dragon Tree have been in decline for a long time. The species is present in five of the seven islands in the Canaries and the total population is reduced to a few hundred trees. In Madeira and Porto Santo, it was once an important component of the vegetation in more arid areas but is reduced today to nine individuals in the wild (in Madeira)&#160;(one wild mature tree and eight from reinforcement planting). A survey in 1996 revealed new subpopulations in North Africa, in the Anezi region of the Anti-Atlas Mts. in Morocco. Thousands of individuals exist on steep quartzite cliffs in inaccessible gorges. These subpopulations are likely to represent a distinct variant of the species.<br/><br/>The total population in the Canary Islands was estimated to be <em>c</em>.1,799 individuals (Mesa Coello&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015, Gobierno de Canarias 2017), of which <em>c</em>.1,185 are mature, however, these estimates included introduced and cultivated individuals. Excluding the non-natural populations on&#160;La Palma, El Hierro, and Gomera,&#160;Mesa Coello&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(2015) found there to be 1,373 individuals (corresponding exclusively to the population on Tenerife&#160;only), of which 897 are adults and 476 are juveniles. However, the 2015 survey (Mesa Coello&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015) also included two subpopulations that are considered to comprise of predominantly non-natural individuals (R.S. Almeida Pérez <em>pers. comm.</em> 2017); Isogue, and La Laguna-Valle Tabares-Tahodio. The Isogue subpopulation contains three mature individuals that are considered to be of natural origin out of 168 in total, with the remainder resulting from reintroductions that took place in the Isogue ravine a number of years ago. The&#160;La Laguna-Valle Tabares-Tahodio subpopulation comprises 74 individuals (70 adults and four juveniles), however none of these individuals can be considered wild, since the whole environment is strongly&#160;anthropocised (R.S. Almeida Pérez <em>pers. comm</em>. 2017). Within the La Laguna-Valle Tabares-Tahodio&#160;subpopulation is included the reintroduction site at Los Campitos ('Las Mesas in Mesa Coello&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(2015)), which represents more than 80% of the individuals within the subpopulation. Taking into account the above, from the total number of specimens on Tenerife (1,373) we would have to subtract 239 individuals corresponding to most the Isogue subpopulation and all of the La Laguna-Valle de Tabares-Tahodio subpopulation, resulting in a total of 1,134 wild individuals for the whole island, of which 674 are adults.<br/><br/>On Tenerife, subpopulations are generally small and highly dispersed and are mostly located in the ancient geological areas of the mountains of Anaga, Teno and Adeje. On Gran Canaria, the single wild individual in the Pino Gordo Gorge (San Nicolas de Tolentino) died in 2009 (Á. Marrero Rodríguez <em>pers. comm</em>. 2017), although there are two other autochthonous individuals in Meleguinas and in the ravine of Alonso (Santa Brígida).&#160;The dynamics of the subpopulations are kept relatively stable, being observed to even have a perceptible natural regeneration in some enclaves, indicating good germination. The population recovery is slow, with the species in general behaving regressively.&#160;Many aspects of their reproductive biology are unclear, and the reason for the rarity today on Gran Canaria is uncertain.&#160;It currently shows little or no ability to disperse over long&#160;distance&#160;(Almeida Pérez&#160;2004).<br/><br/>On Madeira, the species is often cultivated in gardens but is extinct in the wild on the island of Porto Santo. On Madeira itself, one wild mature tree survives on a slope near the village Ribeira Brava, with two nearby adult individuals destroyed during strong storms that hit the island in December 2009 and February 2010. Another individual that existed near Ponta do Garajau in the east of Funchal fell into the sea in 1982 during a storm (Press and Short 1994). Another set of individuals exist at Funchal in the Núcleo dos Dragoeiros das Neves – IFCN (Instituto de Florestas e Conservação da Natureza), but it is strongly suspected that they have been introduced&#160;there (Constância 2005).&#160;In 2009, the Madeira Botanical Garden carried out reinforcement planting of 10 plants in its natural habitat, and as of 2018 eight still survive.<br/><br/>In the Azores, the species' origin is uncertain.&#160;At least two subpopulations, one in São&#160;Jorge and another in Flores, appear to have originated naturally due to the steep locations. There are around 200-300 individuals on the island of São Jorge (C. Aguiar <em>pers. obs</em>. 2010), and an updated census is recommended. There are apparently more individuals on Flores, Faial and Corvo but it is not known how many there are or of they can be considered native. Schäfer (2002) states that the species is rare on Flores and very rare on Faial.&#160;In this assessment, the species is considered to&#160;not&#160;be native in the Azores archipelago, and these individuals not included in assessments, until confirmation that these are indeed native.<br/><br/>The overall population trend is declining, with one natural mature individual now known on Madeira, and the species went extinct in the wild on Gran Canaria within the last ten years. On Tenerife, most remaining individuals are found in inaccessible areas and are isolated from the more significant threats. It is possible that the species is recovering in some areas on Tenerife, and in areas where livestock grazing has been reduced, subpopulations have recovered (Mesa Coello&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The dynamics of their subpopulations remain relatively stable, showing a perceptible natural regeneration in some enclaves (bco. del Infierno, Roque de Las Ánimas, Roque de Tierra), indicating a good germination. However, population recovery is slow. It should be added that even in the core subpopulations where some natural regeneration is observed, several threat factors continue to occur, such as uncontrolled grazing, competition with exotic plants, and stochastic&#160;environmental factors such as rocky landslides and falls due to wind storms. Taken together, these factors cause losses of greater or lesser consideration. In addition, there is significant geographical fragmentation of the different subpopulations and the net separation of the three main population centres: Anaga, Teno and Adeje.<br/><br/>Little is known about the size and trend of the Cabo Verde subpopulation.",Decreasing,"This species is found in the south-west Atlas Mountains of Morocco (with records from there segregated as subspecies&#160;<em>ajgal</em>;&#160;Almeida Pérez&#160;2004), Cabo Verde (subsp.<em>&#160;caboverdeana</em>), the Canary Islands, and Madeira. In the Canaries, records are from Tenerife (most records), and also from Gran Canaria, La Palma, El Hierro and Gomera; however the subpopulations on&#160;La Palma, El Hierro and Gomera are all considered to have resulted from introduction through cultivation (R.S. Almeida <em>pers. comm</em>. 2017). The species is also found on the Azores, but the subpopulation there is of unknown origin. The species is widespread in cultivation and the origin of some subpopulations remains uncertain, however even if reintroduced subpopulations on Tenerife were included, as these may have occurred within the natural historical range of the species, the extent of occurrence (EOO) and AOO would still be restricted. In this assessment, the species is considered to&#160;not&#160;be native in the Azores archipelago, where its presence is likely the result of early introduction by the Portuguese from seeds from Madeira (or even the Canary Islands) and from Cape Verde, with some individuals there observed to have the characteristic of the Cape Verdean subspecies (subsp.&#160;<em>caboverdeana</em>). However, there are possibly natural subpopulations in Azores in São Jorge and Flores.<br/><br/>The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at less than 412 km<sup>2</sup>.

However the species is found in several protected areas and is protected by law. It is also found in many <em>ex situ </em>collections across the world. Ongoing monitoring is recommended.","The main habitat is in or near ravines, close to<em> Salix canariensis </em>habitat, and colluvial soils within thermophilous forest and <em>Euphorbia </em>shrub.

This palm is also threatened by the Red Palm Weevil (<em>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</em>) which principally affects male trees, however this weevil, which was introduced to the islands in 2005 on adult palms from mainland Spain and from North Africa, has been eradicated from the archipelago at present. The Four-Spotted Coconut Weevil (<em>Diocalandra frumenti</em>) continues to be a problem. The invasive South American Palm Borer (<em>Paysandisia archon</em>) is not yet reported from the Canaries, but is another potentially significant threat to this endemic palm, and has been found to have infected <em>P. canariensis</em> palms cultivated&#160;in Spain and imported to the UK (Reid and Moran 2009).

These authors consider that this cover reduction results from a combination of factors, especially overgrazing and decreasing interest in this culture. In the last twenty years there some evidence of local resilience of the steppe vegetation at least: in the ""no-mans land"" along the borders of Morocco and Algeria (closed since 1994), in some conservation areas for great bustard in eastern Morocco and around big cities like Oran and Tunis where traditional overgrazing is decreasing fast.<br/><br/>In the Iberian Peninsula the culture of this species was almost abandoned in the last 50 years and is now residual. This grass populations may have decreased significantly, but the species is still frequent in the historical areas of occurrence, covering c.6,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Spain and Portugal (Cortina&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). In north Africa this species still form steppes in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco but is facing ongoing decrease in area&#160;(Omar and Khadra 2007), mainly on high plains from eastern Morocco until central Tunisia which were hosting, in the past, the main sub population of this species.&#160;There is no reliable information regarding generation length for this species (10?, 20?, 50? years).",Decreasing,"This grass occurs throughout the western Mediterranean basin, forming steppes that cover c.32,000 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Cortina&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009), which are the remains of an estimated 86,500 km<sup>2</sup> area covered by this species some decades ago (Le Houérou 1995).&#160;In Europe the grass ranges from southern France to Portugal, also occurring on Mediterranean islands, including the Balearic Islands (Ibiza and Menorca) and Corsica. In south France is found in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, in the Var Department&#160;but appears to have disappeared from Bouches-du-Rhône Department (Association Tela Botanica 2014). In the&#160;Iberian Peninsula, the grass is mostly found in the drier regions of central and southern Spain (<em>e.g.</em> Almeria, Granada, Albacete and Alicante provinces), covering c.6,000 km<sup>2 </sup>(Cortina&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009), also occurring in the extreme south of Portugal in the Algarve region (Flora-On 2014).<br/><br/>In north Africa this species forms vast steppes that are mostly distributed in a thin latitudinal fringe, from western Libya to western Morocco (Cortina&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;In Morocco this plant is found from eastern Morocco, the Rif and Middle Atlas mountains and along the High Atlas range to the southwest of the county. In Algeria the main range is from the littoral areas of Algiers-Oran, through the High Plateaus, until the Saharan Atlas), in Tunisia it is found in the north and center of the country, and in Libya, the grass is found in the mountain areas in the northwestern parts of the country.<br/><br/>GBIF (2014) shows a few records from Egypt, Israel, Jordan and some Greek islands, however those records are probably the result of misidentifications or introduced specimens used in landscape restoration or rock gardening.

The species breeds from May or April in loose colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005a), after which flocks gather to undertake moult migrations to favoured areas (with good feeding opportunities and access to safe roosting sites) (Kear 2005a) to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting c.1 month (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is highly gregarious (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) outside of the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988), with large concentrations forming during the post-breeding moult and before the autumn migration (e.g. flocks of up to 25,000 individuals) (Scott and Rose 1996). The species feeds diurnally, especially during the morning and evening, although non-breeding birds may also feed at night (Kear 2005a). It roosts at night and during the middle of the day on open water (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), and may fly to feeding areas more than 10 km away from roosting sites (Kear 2005a) (optimal distance 2-5 km away) (Vickery and Gill 1999). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season the species inhabits wetlands surrounded by fringing vegetation in open grassland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), sedge or heather moorland (Johnsgard 1978), arctic tundra, steppe or semi-desert from sea-level up to 2,300 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). It nests near streams, saltmarshes (Kear 2005a), river flood-plains, reedy marshes, grassy bogs, damp meadows, reed-lined freshwater lakes and estuaries (Johnsgard 1978) close to potential feeding sites such as meadows, grasslands, stubble fields and newly sown cereal fields (Kear 2005a). It requires isolated islands (Kear 2005a) in lakes (Johnsgard 1978) or on along the coast (Kear 2005a) out of reach of land predators for nesting (Kear 2005a). In the autumn (before migration) the species also frequents agricultural land (e.g. sugar-beet, maize and cereal fields) (Kear 2005a). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the winter the species inhabits lowland farmland in open country (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), swamps (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), lakes (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), reservoirs (Madge and Burn 1988), coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Diet </strong>The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of grass (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), the roots, shoots, leaves, stems, seedheads and fruits of other herbaceous marsh vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), aquatic plants (Johnsgard 1978), and agricultural grain and potatoes (especially in the winter) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow construction of plant matter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) placed among reedbeds, on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), in or at the base of trees, under bushes or in sheltered hollows on isolated wooded islands on lakes or along coasts (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005a), as well as on rafts of vegetation in rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). Although the species is only semi-colonial, nests may be concentrated within a small area (e.g. placed 11 m apart on small islands) (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Management information</strong> On the Vejlerne nature reserve, Denmark, it was found that reedbeds left unharvested for 5-13 years supported the highest nesting densities of this species (Nyeland Kristiansen 1998). Low nesting densities were found in reedbeds in the first four years after reed cutting, and no nests were found in reedbeds cut in the year of study (shoot density may have been too low to provide adequate cover) or in reedbeds left uncut for sixteen years (reed stems may have been too dense) (Nyeland Kristiansen 1998).","This species is threatened by considerable hunting pressures across much of its range (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and is susceptible to poisoning from lead shot ingestion (Mateo <em>et al.</em> 1998). It is also persecuted by farmers as it can cause considerable crop damage (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).

It is present on its breeding grounds from May or June to August or September (Kear 2005a) where it breeds in small but often closely packed colonies (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) of 5-50 pairs, occasionally singly or in groups of up to 150 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). It uses the same nesting sites year after year (Johnsgard 1978) and sometimes nests among seabird colonies (Madge and Burn 1988). After the young hatch the adults undergo a flightless moult period near the breeding grounds between mid-July and mid-August that lasts for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996). The species migrates to autumn staging areas in September (Kear 2005a) from which it travels via regular stop-over sites (Madge and Burn 1988) to the wintering grounds, arriving in late-September (Kear 2005a). The return migration begins in April or May, the species moving to spring staging areas where it may be present for 20-30 days before migrating northwards (Kear 2005a). The species is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season, often feeding in dense concentrations on coastal grasslands during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988). In winter habitats it roosts on water (Madge and Burn 1988) or on sandbanks near saltmarshes and pastureland (Peberdy 1991). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in Arctic semi-desert tundra (fjellmark) (Kear 2005a)on crags, rocky outcrops (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), cliffs, rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1978) and coastal islands (Svalbard) (Kear 2005a) near wetlands such as lakes, rivers, marshes, the upper parts of fjords, coastlines (Johnsgard 1978), wet meadows and mudflats (Kear 2005a). In years when the snow is slow to melt the species first forages on grassy vegetation on south-facing mountain slopes fertilised by the droppings of cliff-nesting seabirds before moving down to breeding areas (Kear 2005a). It also returns to these slopes after the moulting period before autumn migration (Kear 2005a). After the young hatch families may disperse away from rocky ground to more vegetated areas surrounding tundra lakes and rivers (Kear 2005a). <em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season the species frequents tidal mudflats, saltmarshes (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005a) and adjacent coastal meadows (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (especially improved<strong></strong>rough pastures<strong></strong>and arable land (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a)), with agricultural fields becoming increasingly more important as winter feeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996). <strong>Diet </strong>The species is herbivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) its diet consisting of the leaves, stems and seed-heads of grasses, sedges, aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a), mosses (Kear 2005a), various herbs (especially white clover <em>Trifolium repens</em> in the winter) (Peberdy 1991, Vickery and Gill 1999) and shrubs (e.g. arctic willow <em>Salix arctica</em>) (Johnsgard 1978). It may also take agricultural grain and vegetables during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow depression in a low mound of vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998) positioned on rocky ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a), rocky outcrops (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998), among rocky crags, on steep cliffs (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), on the tops of low hills (Johnsgard 1978), or on low vegetation hummocks and snow-free patches on islands in river channels (Snow and Perrins 1998). Nesting sites accumulate nesting materials as they are often used year after year (Johnsgard 1978), and the species may sometimes nest among seabird colonies (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Management information </strong>An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on improved grasslands with high abundances of the grass <em>Lolium perenn</em>e and white clover <em>Trifolium repens</em> (Vickery and Gill 1999) (the growth of which is greatly influenced by the amount of summer grazing, which controls the grass height) (Peberdy 1991). Preferred fields were between 4 and 10 ha in area (the species avoided fields of less than 2-3 ha), and at an optimal distance of less than 5 km away from roosting sites (maximum 7 km away) (Vickery and Gill 1999). The species was also found to show a preference for grasslands with swards less than 10 cm in height (optimum 2 cm) in fields that had been cut for silage and then grazed (although there was no major difference in feeding intensity on pastures grazed with different livestock) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Overall winter use of grassland fertilised with large amounts of nitrogen was significantly greater than the use of unfertilised grassland by the species (Vickery and Gill 1999). The Barnacle Goose Management Scheme (BGMS) in Scotland, UK recommends fertilising farmland adjacent to reserves containing wintering groups of this species at times when geese are present (e.g. autumn or winter) and grazing stock (sheep or cattle) are absent (Cope <em>et al.</em> 2003). The BGMS also awards payments to farmers who manage pastures outside of established reserves for reducing the level of disturbance (e.g. scaring away feeding flocks) on their land (Cope <em>et al.</em> 2003).<strong></strong>","Today the species is fully protected throughout its range, although adults, eggs and down were once exploited by humans (Kear 2005a), and the species may be disturbed by shooting even though it is not directly hunted (Peberdy 1991). The species faces possible threats from persecution (disturbance) by farmers as in winter it favours grasslands and pastures used for grazing livestock (Cope <em>et al.</em> 2003).

African breeding populations are nomadic or sedentary however and make local dispersive movements to temporary wetlands following seasonal rains (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species breeds from April to July in Eurasia and North Africa (the populations south of the Sahara breeding mainly during the rainy season) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in single- or mixed-species colonies that can be up to 2,000 pairs in size (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). After breeding Palearctic populations migrate south from August to November (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), returning to the breeding colonies between February and May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species feeds solitarily (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or in small groups of 2-5 individuals during the breeding season (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) although in winter and on migration large feeding flocks may form (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and in Africa resident populations may feed in parties of up to 20 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species is mainly crepuscular (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), roosting by day and night in large (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) often mixed-species (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) groups in sheltered woods and reedbeds (these roosts may draw in herons feeding up to 80 km away) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species inhabits permanent or temporary wetlands (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) showing a preference for fresh waters with abundant marsh vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), reedbeds, nearby bushes, trees and scrub (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Habitats frequented include swampy plains, river valleys, deltas, lakes, ponds, canals and ditches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although rice paddyfields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) are now the principle habitat throughout much of its range (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On migration (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) the species may also occur on estuaries, inshore reefs or islets (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It generally avoids dry habitats and those with very high rainfall (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and usually breeds in the lowlands although it has bred on montane lakes up to 2,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of larval insects although fish and amphibians (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. frogs and tadpoles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) up to 10 cm long, grasshoppers, beetles, butterflies, spiders, crustaceans, molluscs and exceptionally small birds may also be taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a well-constructed platform (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) usually placed less than 2 m (occasionally up to 20 m) high near or over water in reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or in dense thickets of trees or shrubs (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. of willow <em>Salix</em> spp. or poplar <em>Populus</em> spp.) (Hafner and Didner 1997), preferring nesting sites within 5 km of feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds in single- or mixed-species colonies that can be up to 2,000 pairs in size (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), neighbouring pairs building nests 5-10 m apart (occasionally as close as 0.5 m) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).",The greatest threat to this species is the loss and deterioration of natural and man-made freshwater habitats (e.g. through changes to flood regimes in rice paddyfields) and wet woodlands (e.g. through woodcutting and burning) (Hafner and Didner 1997). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).,"The global population is estimated at 370,000-780,000 (Wetlands International 2015).

The species breeds from May onwards, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the thaw (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It usually nests solitarily on smaller waters but may nest in loosely colonial groups on larger waters (e.g. several pairs nesting a few metres apart on the same lake) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On migration, large flocks of 200-1,200 individuals may form, with similar concentrations occurring on rich marine fishing grounds during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).

It will nest on pools as small as 10-20 m long or on lakes up to 5 ha in area, showing a preference for those in treeless areas that have well-vegetated margins and low islets or promontories on which to nest (Snow and Perrins 1998). It generally avoids waters with dense floating or emergent vegetation and steep rocks above the water, and if feeding conditions are inadequate in the pool chosen for breeding the species may fly to the coast or to lakes with higher abundances of fish in order to feed (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season, the species frequents inshore waters along sheltered coasts, occasionally occurring inland on lakes, pools, reservoirs and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fish spawn, aquatic insects, annelid worms and plant matter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a small depression or a mound of plant matter, built in shallow water up to 10 m from the shore or very near the water's edge, on islets or small promontories (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998).

The severity of impacts from this predator may increase, should the population be allowed to increase and spread. On Kaua'i, the introduced Common Barn Owl <em>Tyto alba</em> is a major predator of adults (Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017).

Its breeding season is variable depending on locality, forming colonies on offshore islands on high ground or slopes, usually among rocks but also in soft soil between trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","<p>Brown Rats&#160;<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>&#160;and House Rats&#160;<em>R. rattus</em>, are considered to exert a considerable predation pressure on the species where they establish on breeding islands, and may be a key determinant of the present breeding distribution, possibly along with cats. Cats&#160;<em>Felis catus</em>&#160;predate large numbers of adult and fledgling Leach's Storm-petrels where present, and may have been responsible for the extirpation of the species from a number of formerly occupied sites. Foxes caused the extirpation of the species from numerous islands in Alaska following their introduction, with their eradication on a number of islands leading to subsequent recolonization by Leach’s Storm-petrel. Mice&#160;<em>Mus musculus&#160;</em>are also suspected to be impacting the species through nest predation, but the effects are unclear.<br/><br/>Leach’s Storm-petrel&#160;<em>Hydrobates leucorhous&#160;</em>experiences high levels of predation from native predators. In 1997, Herring Gulls <em>Larus argentatus&#160;</em>killed almost 49,000 adult petrels during the breeding season on Great Island, Newfoundland, which at the time had a breeding colony of around 270,000 pairs (Stenhouse <em>et al.</em> 2000). Great Skuas <em>Catharacta skua</em>&#160;predate Leach’s Storm-petrels, with around 21,000 individuals killed each year in the St. Kilda colony; however, these primarily represent non-breeding birds that had immigrated from other, larger colonies, hence this is thought to have a relatively small impact on the population (Stead 2010). Great <em>Larus marinus&#160;</em>and Lesser Black-backed Gulls <em>L. fuscus&#160;</em>are also known to predate relatively large numbers of adult Leach's Storm-petrel (Stenhouse <em>et al.</em> 2000), though the extent to which this drives declines is uncertain.</p>  <p>Research activities have been shown to cause considerable disturbance to Leach’s Storm-petrel and represent a cause of reduced reproductive success. In a study by Blackmer (2004), it was found that weekly investigator disturbance halved the hatching success of Leach’s Storm-petrel nests, and daily disturbance caused a 56% reduction. Of all the reproductive failures in this study, egg desertion accounted for 91% and only occurred in pairs in the disturbed treatment groups.</p>  Foraging ranges during the breeding season for five out of seven western Atlantic colonies overlapped with offshore oil and gas operations; three of these colonies have declined in recent decades (Hedd <em>et al.</em> 2018). Attraction to lights and flares and subsequent collisions with oil rigs poses a risk (Hedd <em>et al. </em>2018). Large oil spills represent a relatively unlikely but potentially very severe threat, although due to this bird’s large range, it would be likely to affect only a small portion of the population. Small spills of hydrocarbons and synthetic drilling fluids are relatively common (CNLOPB 2012, McCrary <em>et al.</em> 2003) and contribute to chronic oil pollution in the sea (National Research Council 1985).","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;20,000,000 individuals. &#160;Based on the compilation of available data the current population comprises 6.7-8.3 million breeding pairs; 40-48% of these breed in the Atlantic basin and 52-60% in the Pacific. Throughout the western Atlantic (&gt;90% of basin total), populations are declining, including at Baccalieu Island, Newfoundland, Canada, home to the largest colony. The population at Baccalieu Island, estimated at 3.3 million breeding pairs in 1984 (Sklepkovych and Montevecchi 1989), had declined to 2.02 million pairs by 2013 (Environment Canada <em>unpublished data</em>), and the former second and third regionally largest colonies have declined by &gt;50% since the late 1990s (Wilhelm <em>et al. </em>2015, Environment Canada <em>unpublished data</em>). In the eastern Atlantic, the population at St. Kilda is also declining, this being the largest colony in the UK and Ireland (Newson <em>et al.</em> 2008). &#160;Population trends in the Pacific are less well known. In Alaska, where Leach’s&#160;<em>Hydrobates leucorhous</em>&#160;and Fork-tailed Storm-petrels <em>H. furactus</em> are largely combined for monitoring purposes, population trends are stable or increasing (Slater and Byrd 2009, Dragoo <em>et al</em>. 2016), the large population at Daikoku Island, Japan may have declined since 1982, while trends of western North American and Russian populations are unknown. Despite these knowledge gaps, compiling available data collected between 1977 and 2016, representing 75-80% of the global population (including Europe, eastern North America, and Japan), points to a decline of ≥30% over three generations (39 years, based on a generation length estimated by BirdLife to be 13 years).<br/><br/>Definitive information on Leach’s Storm-petrel population decline comes mainly from colonies within the Atlantic basin. &#160;Recent genetics research indicates that while there is no genetic structure among Atlantic colonies, populations within the Atlantic and the Pacific are genetically distinct (Bicknell <em>et al.</em> 2012). &#160;Evidence of movement of pre-breeding birds among colonies within the Atlantic, led to the conclusion that North Atlantic birds may be operating as a metapopulation and that management of this species may be best viewed at an oceanic scale (Bicknell <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014).",Decreasing,"This species has an extensive global range.

It breeds in the high Arctic from late-May or early-June (depending on the timing of the Arctic thaw) <strong></strong> in single pairs or loose groups<strong></strong>, often with colonies of nesting gulls or terns (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005);<strong></strong> although it is not itself a colonial species (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Males undergo short post-breeding moult migrations<strong></strong>, often gathering in small or large flocks (up to 4,000 in Iceland) (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> while females are incubating (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Females usually moult in the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, although large concentrations (500-1,000 individuals) of moulting females have been recorded away from breeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. During the moulting period the species is flightless for a period of c.3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The autumn migration begins after the moulting period in mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, with males tending to remain much further north than females or immatures (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong> leading to some sexual segregation during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. The species is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season<strong></strong> and is commonly observed in small or large flocks<strong></strong> sometimes of several thousand individuals (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The return spring migration generally begins in late-February (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> although flocks of non-breeders may remain in the south, often in winter quarters, during the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in tundra, wooded tundra<strong></strong> and moorland regions in the high Arctic<strong></strong>, occupying small, shallow<strong></strong>, freshwater lakes, pools and rivers<strong></strong> with grassy shorelines and high densities of invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It shows a preference for water less than 6 m deep (usually 2 m) for diving (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters on shallow coastal waters&#160; less than 10 m deep<strong></strong> (especially in the vicinity of sewage outlets)<strong></strong>, as well as sheltered bays<strong></strong>, estuaries <strong></strong> and brackish coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is also found inland on large lakes <strong></strong> and reservoirs during this season (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. During the winter, its diet consisting predominantly of molluscs (Johnsgard 1978) such as muscles, cockles and clams while in coastal habitats and <em>Hydrobia </em>snails while in brackish waters (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). Other food sources include insects<strong></strong>, aquatic insect larvae<strong></strong>, crustaceans such as amphipods, worms, small fish<em></em><strong></strong>, and the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants such as sedges <em></em>and water weeds (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Breeding</strong> The nest is a shallow depression close to water<strong></strong> on the ground<strong></strong>, either in thick vegetation<strong></strong>, in cracks in rocks, under woody shrubs or under perennial herbaceous vegetation less than 50 cm high (Iceland) (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). The species is not colonial but it will sometimes nest among gulls and terns (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, with neighbouring nests being placed as close as 1 m in some areas (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth, a large marine bay, resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>. It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>.   <p></p>","<p>Incidental capture in commercial fisheries poses a major threat to this species which shows a relatively high vulnerability to bycatch (Sonntag <em>et al.</em> 2012). Entanglement in fishing equipment causes an estimated 5-10% annual mortality in the Baltic region (Jensen 2009). The species winters near major fishing areas in Europe, North America and Japan, thus interaction with fisheries is common throughout the range.  </p><p>Wetland habitats critical to breeding success are potentially threatened by climate change. Remotely sensed imaging has revealed landscape-level changes, including the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska, associated with a warming climate, longer growing seasons and increased potential evapotranspiration (Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006). Audubon’s (2014) climate model predicts the loss of over half of the North American summer range with suitable climatic conditions, with similar trends likely in Eurasia. Climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes throughout the sensitive ecosystems in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reduced duration of spring snow cover in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Greater Scaup, possibly due to trophic mismatch, with a projected 12.9% decline in population by 2080, compared to the 1980 census (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Future ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Scaup diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Certain colonies in the Pacific Northwest may be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium originating from mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, raising the possibility that heavy metal pollution could be contributory to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). The Scaup’s habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in winter, also exposes it to risk from other pollutants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017).</p>  <p>Flocks often occur in vicinity of oil-related developments and are therefore susceptible to oiling and related pollutants, particularly when moulting and during winter. Oil pollution could also impact the species indirectly through decreased abundance or quality of invertebrate prey (Kirby <em>et al.</em> 1993, Kear 2005). Oil and gas exploration in Siberia may have disruptive impacts on breeding grounds and could potentially be associated with an increase in hunting pressures (Jensen 2009, Mineyev 1998). Wind farms may represent a threat to the Greater Scaup, having been shown to affect duck population densities more severely than those of other species groups (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2007). However, it has been found that collision rates are lower than for other groups (Dürr 2013 <em>per</em> Fox <em>et al. </em>2015) and, as such, wind farms are likely to only be damaging to the population when inappropriately placed (Drewitt &amp; Langston 2006).<br/></p>  At present, direct persecution only appears to have a low impact on a minority of the population, with annual mortality in the EU estimated at 0.6% (Mooji 2005) or not more than 2% (Jensen 2009). In the last 10-year period with available data (2004-2014), the estimated harvest of Greater Scaup in US and Canada ranged from 56,000 to 104,000 birds and showed a decreasing trend in population size (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). Another study in North America found little evidence that harvest was  associated with population decline (Afton and Anderson 2001). Low levels of hunting have also been reported in north-western Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). Although wintering in densely populated coastal areas (Europe, N. America, Japan) makes the species an exposed hunting target, persecution is thought to have negligible effects on the population as a whole.<p></p>  <p></p>","The global population is estimated to number c. 4,920,000-5,130,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).&#160;The breeding population in Europe is estimated at 134,000-178,000 pairs, which equates to 269,000-355,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"Summer breeding grounds of the species range across the northern limits of Europe (including <strong>Iceland</strong>) and Asia, through the Aleutian Islands (year-round breeding) to Alaska (<strong>USA</strong>), and across to the Atlantic coast of <strong>Canada </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).

Some populations, e.g. in Spain, remain predominantly sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Autumn movements are often protracted, with dispersal beginning in mid-August and lasting until late-November (peaking in October). The return migration begins in March (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species's migratory movements are mainly nocturnal, although diurnal migration is known in the Palearctic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds between May and June in the Northern Hemisphere (although laying dates often vary extensively between years and lakes), and nests in reed swamps in colonies of up to 2000 nests, although it may also nest in isolated pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldså&#160;2004). It forages diurnally (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Fjeldså&#160;2004) and is highly gregarious, both on migration and during the winter, forming concentrations of hundreds of thousands at certain sites in North America and Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldså&#160;2004). After arrival at autumn staging grounds (e.g. Mono Lake in California) the species becomes flightless for 3 to 4 months due to loss of weight from the pectoral muscles (Ogilvie and Rose 2003). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season the species frequents permanent and temporary small, shallow, highly eutrophic pools with lush vegetation, such as freshwater marshes and lakes with dispersed submergent vegetation and patches of reeds, as well as ponds and fish ponds, sewage farms, quiet river backwaters and newly flooded areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Konter 2001, Fjeldså&#160;2004). In southern Russia and Kazakhstan, it shows a preference for variably developed reed swamps and gypsotrophic lakes (alkaline waters with rich submergent vegetation such as <em>Chara</em> and <em>Potamogeton</em> <em>pectinatus</em>) (Fjeldså&#160;2004). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species moves to salt lakes, hyper-saline industrial evaporation ponds and reservoirs, or to coastal estuaries, arms of the sea, and inshore shallows in bays and channels (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Fjeldså&#160;2004).&#160;<strong>Diet</strong> The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting of adult and larval insects (such as aquatic bugs, terrestrial and aquatic beetles, damselflies, dragonflies, midges and brine-flies), molluscs, crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimps), amphibians (e.g. small frogs and tadpoles), nereid worms, snails and small fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Konter 2001, Fjeldså&#160;2004). <strong>Breeding site</strong> It usually nests colonially in thinly spaced, emergent marsh vegetation (such as <em>Scirpus, Typha </em>or sedge <em>Carex</em>), or on dense mats of floating waterweed, sometimes far from the shore (Fjeldså&#160;2004). The nest is a floating platform of aquatic vegetation anchored to emergent vegetation such as reeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Fjeldså&#160;2004).","Sporadic episodes of catastrophic mortality in the Salton Sea, which have been as large as 150,000 individuals (around 6% of the North American population) in 1991-1992 (Meteyer <em>et al.</em> 2004), appear to be driven by both gradual and episodic reductions in the population of pileworms, the primary prey source available to grebes in the winter (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2007). These reductions are likely due to an increase in salinity of the lake reducing overall pileworm productivity and increasing water column stratification. This results in the production of anoxic conditions with high sulphide levels in deeper water, subsequent weather-mediated mixing events bring this water to the surface, killing pileworms and resulting in the death of grebes too weak to move onto better wintering grounds by starvation (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2007). Populations have also been known to crash in winter habitats during El Niño Southern Oscillation events due to reductions in food availability due to warming sea-surface temperatures, although they rebound to previous levels afterwards (Jehl <em>et al.</em> 2002).","The global population is estimated to number c.3,900,000-4,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 46,400-77,500 pairs, which equates to 92,800-155,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species is found on every continent except Australasia and Antarctica.

It also attends trawlers and will form large congregations where food is plentiful.

Young birds will migrate to the extreme south of its range, whereas adults range less extensively but still regularly winter in the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","Northern Gannets are consistently recorded as bycatch across fisheries in the Atlantic. It is the species most freqently killed as bycatch in fisheries assessed in Portuguese Atlantic waters, and captured at a relatively high rate in demersal longline operations, but also set-nets and purse-seines (Oliveira&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Total estimates of numbers killed are lacking. In nearshore water off the east coast of the U.S., estimates of under 500 individuals per year suggest that population level impacts may be relatively small; however, this is derived from observers on less than 5% of fisheries within a small proportion of the range, and there is no cumulative assessment of impact (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). Considering the observation of bycatch in fisheries across the range of the Northern Gannet (Smith and Morgan 2005, García-Barcelona&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010, Oliviera <em>et al. </em>2015) and evidence of increased breeding populations following the closure of Canadian gillnet fisheries (Regular <em>et al. </em>2013),&#160;levels of bycatch are sufficient to cause significant declines in the species.

House Rats are present on many of the islands on which the species breeds or would be likely to breed, and, along with cats, is thought to be one of the main determinants of the current breeding distribution. In one colony on Madeira predation of Shearwater chicks by Madeiran Wall Lizards <em>Teira dugessii</em> has been recorded in up to 10% of nests, however no overall impact on colony breeding success has been found and lizard predation is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level (Matias <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p>  <p>The large colony in Desertas Island, Madeira suffers intense human exploitation for food or fish bait, which also occurs at a lower level in other North East Atlantic sites, although not in the Salvage Islands, Madeira following the declaration of the islands as a national park (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species may be at risk of incidental capture in longline fisheries, but as yet, no significant effects of bycatch on adult mortality have been documented (Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Due to the species’ foraging habit and wide range overlapping with many commercial fishing lanes, it is thought to suffer a heightened risk of mortality from oil spills and other marine pollution.

The level of impact on the local populations is unknown, but harvesting is likely to be contributory to limiting population size, especially in the smaller colonies. Attraction to artificial light poses another potential threat, with grounded fledglings being recorded from e.g. the Canary Islands (Rodriguez and Rodriguez 2009), however the total number killed as a result of light pollution is thought to be negligible in proportion to the global population (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014).

The population trend is difficult to determine however the population is not believed to be declining sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Pelagic movements are easily divided into frequent foraging trips around the breeding areas, rapid long-distance migrations, and smaller-scale movements within a well defined wintering ground (González-Solís <em>et al</em>. 2009). Breeding starts in April on barren offshore islands, where breeding pairs occupy cliffs, caves and boulder fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Breeding individuals in the Canary Islands show a unimodal foraging strategy, concentrating on highly productive regions of the African continental shelf (Navarro and González-Solís 2009). Diet is mostly squid, which are obtained mainly by surface-seizing. The species is regularly attracted to trawlers to feed on offal (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","The primary threats to this species include interaction with small- (and large-) scale fisheries, and predation by invasive, non-native species. Together with <em>C. diomedea</em>, it is the main seabird species caught as bycatch by the Spanish longline fleet in the western Mediterranean (Báez <em>et al.</em> 2014). A study by Ramos <em>et al.</em> (2012), utilising long-term capture-recapture data and year-round tracking data for birds on Selvagem Grande, suggests that incidental bycatch by longline fisheries contributes to a decrease in adult survival probability during the breeding season. The species may also suffer the impacts of bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, fledglings suffer direct persecution on the Canary Islands, with negative effects on breeding success (Lopez-Darias <em>et al</em>. 2011), and c. 500-1,500 chicks poached annually on the Azores (Fontaine <em>et al.</em> 2011). A range of invasive predators are present in the species’ range, but their impacts have largely been unaccounted for. The effect of rats on the species not fully understood. In some colonies a high abundance of rats has been shown to have significant negative effects on reproductive success, while in others the opposite effect has been found and is attributed to the rats providing an alternative food source for cats, thereby reducing pressure on chicks (Thibault 2005). Pascal <em>et al.</em> (2008) found a substantial difference in breeding success of Cory’s Shearwaters in areas with (0.82%) and without (0.45%) rat control (see also Thibault 1995). Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> predate large numbers of juveniles and chicks in colonies on the Azores and Madeira, however the impact on breeding success has not been comprehensively assessed (Hervias <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2013). Predation of eggs and chicks by House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> is thought to cause slow but significant reductions in breeding success in parts of the range (Hervias <em>et al</em>. 2013). In one colony, chicks are predated by Madeiran Wall Lizards <em>Teira dugessii</em> which have been recorded in up to 10% of nests, but no overall impact on breeding success has been found (Matias <em>et al</em>. 2009). Lizard predation appears to be a local phenomenon and is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level. Light pollution, and consequent grounding, predominantly of immature individuals, is another threat contributing to the slow, steady decline of the species across its range (Fontaine <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The European population is estimated at 252,000-253,000 pairs, which equates to 504,000-507,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species breeds in the Azores and Madeira (&gt;85% of the  global population, plus a few pairs on the Berlengas Islands off the Portuguese mainland), <strong>Portugal</strong>, and on the Canary Islands, <strong>Spain </strong>(c.15% of the global population [Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006, Derhé 2012]). The vast majority of the population spends the non-breeding season in the Atlantic.<br/>A population  recovery is reported for Selvagem Grande (Savage Islands, Madeira archipelago), the largest colony of Cory's Shearwaters in the world, with an  estimated increase of 4.6% per year since 1980 (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006).  This follows a series of mass culling events in the 1970s, carried out  by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen, which reduced the colony by c.90%  from c.140,000 pairs. Since 1977, strict protection has been enforced  and the population started a steady recovery; however, between 1995 and<em> </em>1998  a decline of more than 13% was reported, before monitoring work was  interrupted. Following fieldwork in 2005, the colony was estimated to  number c.30,000 pairs (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006), which implies  an overall decline of c.110,000 pairs since the mid-20th century.  Following the surveys in 2005, it was estimated that assuming an annual growth  rate of 5%, it would take another 35 years for the colony to reach its  numbers prior to the culling events (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006). The largest colony in the Azores is on the island of Corvo, where the latest population estimate was &gt;6,000 pairs (3,735-10,524) in 2012; however, the colony may have been much larger in the past (Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p>The population trend is difficult to determine owing to gaps in the data, and is therefore considered unknown according to the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015).

In Spain, sporadic counts of breeding populations  occur in some colonies, mostly in the Balearic Islands, but in the  Columbretes counts are more regular. Reproductive success is also  monitored in the Chafarinas (Madroño <em>et al</em>. 2004). A study of the  incidental mortality of seabirds in waters around the Columbretes  Islands (SEO/BirdLife, General Secretariat of Fisheries) found high  numbers of this species were killed by longline fisheries; however,  mortality could be reduced by avoiding setting lines around sunrise and  sunset (Belda and Sanchez 2001). Research projects and awareness  campaigns, some of which were financed through the LIFE Programme have  taken place in Portugal (Cabral 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: Adequate  protection (e.g. through SPAs) of all breeding areas, both current and  historical, should be ensured. Actively managing the breeding colonies  (eliminating predators, recreating the breeding habitat) and removing  predators from the former breeding colonies to promote the natural  return of the species, will also help secure the species. The proper use  of corrective measures in longline fisheries to avoid accidental  capture of birds should be promoted and specific corrective measures to  prevent accidental capture of the species in longline fisheries should  be developed, in collaboration with the fishing industry. Marine areas  which are important for the conservation of the species should be  designated SPAs. Assessments of the environmental impact of new  developments and activities that are planned need to be established. National censuses of this species should be conducted and breeding colonies monitored to determine accurate population trends. Water sports in the vicinity of  breeding colonies should be regulated, especially at night, in order to  avoid disturbing the birds. The regulation of artificial lighting in the  breeding areas and adjacent coastal areas is important to minimize their impact  particularly on young birds at the time of fledging (Madroño <em>et al</em>. 2004).",Afrotropical|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It requires cavity nest-sites, typically in woodland or on man-made structures, close to open areas of short grassland for foraging. At other times, it exploits a wide range of habitats, including moorland, saltmarshes, seashore and tidal flats, stubble fields, orchards, refuse dumps and sewage-treatment works. It roosts in reedbeds, scrub and trees, as well as bridges and buildings and even in town centres.&#160;<br/><br/>Breeding occurs mostly between March and July. The nest is a bulky structure of dry grass, conifer needles, twigs, string and other materials and the cup is lined with softer materials such as grass, feathers, moss, wool, hair and paper, fresh green leaves and flowers. It is typically built in a hole in a tree, cliff, building or other structure and nestboxes are also readily used. Clutches normally consist of four to six eggs (Craig and Feare 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Common Starling is omnivorous, taking animal and plant material all year round, but during the spring animal food predominates and is fed almost exclusively to nestlings (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/>The northern and eastern populations are migratory, whereas southern and western populations as well as those in urban areas tend to be resident (Craig and Feare 2015).","The species is thought to be declining in some areas owing to the intensification and specialization of agriculture and subsequent changes in rural habitats (Craig and Feare 2015), such as decreases in fallow and grassland and increases in autumn-sown arable crops (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).

It breeds in ecotone habitats between forests and plain or open areas at the tree-line, including wooded tundra, mountain steppe, subalpine scrub, marshland with low woody cover, clumps of willow (<em>Salix</em>), alder (<em>Alnus</em>) and birch (<em>Betula</em>) on floodplains, riverbank thickets, reedy and shrub-dominated lakeshores, bushy sites near water. The breeding season lasts from late April to July in central Europe, from late May in Scandinavia, early April to June in Armenia, June to July in Ladakh, May to July in China and May/June to August in North America. The nest is a deep cup of leaves, small twigs, dry grass, rootlets, plant down and moss, which is occasionally lined with animal hair. It is placed among grass and scrub on wet ground and is commonly associated with topographic features such as a hummock, gulley, lip of a bank, or tussock. Clutches consist of four to seven eggs. The diet is principally invertebrates, particularly insects, but it does take some seeds and fruit in the autumn (Collar 2015). The species is mainly migratory, with west Palearctic populations wintering in patches across the Mediterranean Basin and the northern Afrotropics and eastern populations in the Indian subcontinent (Snow and Perrins 1998).","In Europe, Bluethroat experiences pronounced, but largely unexplained, population fluctuations (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar 2015). Some negative trends appear to be explained by natural succession in marshland, drainage and management practices such as reed-cutting, seedling removal and cattle grazing (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), but recovery has taken place without the reversal of these circumstances. In Spain, during the 1990s Bluethroat may have suffered from degradation of habitat through grazing. In Austria, significant losses occurred during the 19<sup>th</sup> century due to drainage. Now, the species faces threats there due to the stabilization of lake levels and the subsequent loss of the reed-belt, as well as due to the occupation of secondary habitats on arable land and subsequent elevated nest predation (Collar 2015).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;4,460,000-7,760,000 pairs, which equates to 8,930,000-15,500,000 mature individuals&#160;(BirdLife International 2015).

It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups from April to June, with males leaving the breeding areas first from May to early-June to undertake extensive moult migrations (females following later) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). During moult, large sexually segregated flocks gather in moulting areas (e.g. in the Netherlands and Russia), although small gatherings are also possible (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). The flightless moult period lasts for around 4 weeks between July and August, after which flocks move southwards to winter quarters from mid-August onwards (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). The species is highly gregarious in winter and on passage, often forming enormous concentrations (although the size of flock depends on the size of the wetland) (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds nocturnally; flocks are roosting by day on open water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat </strong>The species shows a preference for open lowland grassland, prairie or tundra habitats containing freshwater, brackish and saline wetlands with shallow water (10-30 cm deep) to facilitate dabbling (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Wetland habitats include shallow freshwater marshes, small marshy lakes, slow-flowing rivers, wet meadows, flood-plains and sewage ponds (southern Africa), especially favouring ponds with low, dense marginal vegetation and wetlands interspersed with brushy thickets or copses (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). During the winter, it also frequents large inland lakes, brackish coastal lagoons, brackish and saline marshes, shallow fresh or brackish estuaries, tidal flats and river deltas with adjacent agricultural land (e.g. stubble fields) and scattered impoundments (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Steele <em>et al.</em> 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>This species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of algae, seeds (e.g. cereals and rice), tubers (e.g. potatoes), and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants, sedges and grasses, as well as aquatic invertebrates (e.g. insects, molluscs and crustaceans), amphibians and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a slight hollow on the ground amongst vegetation (e.g. rushes, grass or low scrub) and can be close to or more than 1 km away from water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species is not normally colonial, but neighbours may nest as close as 2-3 m apart (Kear 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat loss on its breeding and wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). Reclamation of coastal areas for industrial development poses a threat in Europe, and major river diversion and irrigation schemes threaten wintering areas in Niger and Nigeria (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds in Russia (Grishanov 2006). Over-exploitation is a concern in Europe (Kear 2005). It also suffers poisoning from lead shot ingestion in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994), poisoning from white phosphorous (from firearms) ingestion in Alaska (Steele <em>et al.</em> 1997), and reproductive impairment as a result of selenium accumulation in liver tissues (selenium contained in sub-surface agricultural drain-water used for wetland management in California led to bioaccumulation of the element in the food chain (Paveglio <em>et al.</em> 1997).

In southern Chile, some colonies number up to 200,000 pairs, with the largest colony of up to 4 million individuals on Isla Guafo (Reyes-Arriagada <em>et al.</em> 2007).

Further south, populations tend to be sedentary or only partially migratory. Most migratory movements occur nocturnally, with birds moving in small parties or larger flocks of 200-250 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species breeds January-May in the Palearctic Region, and in spring and summer in temperate areas, but mainly during the rains in Africa and the tropics<strong></strong> (although here it may also breed in any month of the year) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds in mixed colonies of hundreds or thousands of pairs (the largest colony in Europe is 800-1,300 pairs), although it may also nest solitarily or in small groups of 2-10 nests (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is typically a solitary feeder but at abundant temporary food sources, or where available feeding areas are restricted, large congregations may occur (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It feeds at any time day or night, but is most active at dawn or dusk, typically roosting communally or solitary during the middle of the day and at night in trees and on cliffs, low rocks, islets or along shores (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> This species is a generalist in its habitat use, although shallow water, relatively large prey, and four or five months of ice-free breeding season are among the essential characteristics of its habitat (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to 500 or even 1,000 m, occasionally breeding much higher (Snow and Perrins 1998) (2,000 m in Armenia, 3,500-4,000 m in Ladakh, north-west India), inhabits any kind of shallow water, either fresh, brackish or saline, both standing or flowing, and shows a preference for areas with trees as it is commonly an arboreal rooster and nester. Some degree of isolation and protection are also typical of places chosen for roosting and nesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is found inland on broad rivers, narrow streams, lake shores, ornamental ponds, fish-ponds, marshes, flood-plains, reeds swamps, rice-fields and other irrigated areas, river oxbows, reservoirs, ditches, canals, sewage farms, inland deltas, and on islets and emerging rocks (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On the coast the species also frequents deltas, salt-marshes, mangroves, estuaries, tidal mudflats, muddy and sandy shores, and sand-spits (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish and eels 10-25 cm long, as well as amphibians, crabs, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic insects, snakes, small rodents, small birds and plant matter (although this may be incidental,&#160;<strong></strong>or only to aid in pellet formation) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a stick platform that is often re-used over successive years, usually positioned high in a tall tree up to 50 m, but also on the ground or on cliff edges, in reedbeds or in bushes. In reed-beds nests may be built of reeds, and ground nests may be reduced to a slight scrape, ringed with small stones and debris (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species commonly nests in colonies, and nesting sites are typically situated 2-38 km (convenient flying distance) from preferred feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).<strong></strong>","In Europe, the species was heavily persecuted in the nineteenth century due to its consumption of fish, which resulted in competition with fishermen and fish farmers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Although killing at aquaculture farms has not reduced the global population so far (possibly because it is young birds that are mostly killed), 800 individuals are estimated to have died per year at Scottish fish-farms between 1984 and 1987 by being shot, drowned or poisoned by fish farmers (Carss 1994, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Renewed hunting poses a threat to populations in Bavaria (Germany) by decreasing numbers to levels that inhibit recovery following severe winters (severe winters increase mortality rates for juveniles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is vulnerable in Madagascar owing to its restricted range, exceedingly high levels of habitat alteration (from siltation and the need for agricultural land for rice and grazing), hunting, and predation at nesting colonies (Kushlan and Hafner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Timber harvesting is a threat throughout much of the species's range by removing trees used by nesting colonies and/or disturbing nearby colonies (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The global   population is estimated to number c.790,000-3,700,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).

The species breeds from April to June in the western Palearctic, during the rains in Africa, and from June to October in the north of India or November to March in the south of India (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is a colonial breeder and although nesting group sizes are usually small (e.g. 2-3 pairs per colony in Africa) and rarely exceed 50 pairs, colonies of up to 1,000 pairs have been recorded in some areas (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Turner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It often also nests on the periphery of colonies of other heron species such as Grey Heron <em>Ardea cinerea</em> (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In migratory populations, the autumn migration occurs from August to October, with the return passage in the spring beginning in March (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). On migration, the species commonly occurs in small groups (the maximum recorded migratory groups sizes being 300-400 individuals) and throughout the year it will roost communally by day and by night in groups of up to 100 individuals, although it generally feeds solitarily (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is mainly crepuscular, but may also feed diurnally (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits wetlands from sea level to 1,800 m (Madagascar), showing a preference for dense, flooded, freshwater reedbeds (<em>Phragmites</em> spp.) in temperate areas (occupying <em>Typha</em>, <em>Scirpus </em>and <em>Papyrus</em> swamps elsewhere) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It also utilises lake shores, river margins, ditches, canals, brackish water lagoons, rice-fields, mangroves and coastal mudflats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of fish 5-15 cm long (occasionally up to 55 cm), salamanders, frogs, insects (e.g. beetles, dragonflies, hemiptera and locusts), crustaceans, spiders and molluscs, as well as small birds and mammals, snakes and lizards (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a platform of reeds stems or sticks positioned over or beside water up to 3 m high in flooded reedbeds, 3-4 m high in thickets or mangroves or up to 25 m high in trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests in loose single- or mixed-species colonies with Grey Heron <em>Ardea cinerea</em>, and although colony sizes are usually small, large groups of up to 1,000 pairs have been recorded (the colony size depends on the size of the area of marshland) (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information</strong> Studies in southern France have shown that the overall conservation of this species in Europe is favoured by maintaining large uncut reedbeds with relatively high spring water levels (Barbraud <em>et al.</em> 2002).","The main threat to this species in Europe is the loss of reedbeds though direct elimination (to reduce sedimentation) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), agricultural encroachment (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005), water management practices (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. drainage) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) and reed cane harvesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","The global   population is estimated to number c.270,000-570,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).

In the north of its range the species breeds in the local spring (e.g. from April) but in the tropics the timing of breeding coincides with the rains (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species usually nests in monospecific colonies or in small monospecific groups amidst mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). When not breeding the species forages singly or in small flocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of up to 100 individuals (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) and migrates in flocks of up to 100 individuals (Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is most active during the morning and evening (although in coastal areas it forages at low tide regardless of the time of day) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), and often roosts communally up to 15 km away from feeding areas (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species shows a preference for extensive shallow (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (less than 30 cm deep) wetlands with mud, clay or fine sand substrates, generally avoiding waters with rocky substrates, thick vegetation or swift currents (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It inhabits either fresh, brackish or saline (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) marshes, rivers, lakes, flooded areas and mangrove swamps, especially those with islands for nesting or dense emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) and scattered trees or srubs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (preferably willow <em>Salix </em>spp., oak <em>Quercus </em>spp. or poplar <em>Populus </em>spp.) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It may also frequent sheltered marine habitats during the winter such as deltas, estuaries, tidal creeks and coastal lagoons (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (e.g. waterbeetles, dragonflies, caddisflies, locusts and flies), molluscs, crustaceans, worms, leeches, frogs, tadpoles and small fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) up to 10-15 cm long (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It may also take algae or small fragments of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (although these are possibly ingested accidentally with animal matter) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a platform of sticks and vegetation constructed on the ground on islands in lakes and rivers, or alternatively in dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), bushes, mangroves or deciduous trees (e.g. willow <em>Salix </em>spp., oak <em>Quercus </em>spp. or poplar <em>Populus </em>spp.) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) up to 5 m above the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).

Dangerous electricity pylons should be modified or buried. Game crops should be used to enhance prey populations, extensive pastoral farming should be maintained and hedges bordering fields preserved. These measures could be promoted in the EU under agri-environmental regulation. Within Europe, undertaking education campaigns with the active involvement of hunting associations and the continuation of research and monitoring, extending into Portugal and eastern Mediterranean countries would help preserve the species (Tucker and Heath 1994).",Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Populations breeding in the tropics are sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or partially migratory (in relation to rainfall) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), whereas Palearctic and Nearctic populations are migratory (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The timing of the breeding season varies geographically (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although temperate breeders tend to nest in the spring and summer (e.g. April to July) and tropical breeders nest in the part of the rain cycle when food becomes maximally available (this may be during the rains or in the dry season) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species typically breeds in colonies of tens, hundreds or even a thousand pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), sometimes with other species (e.g. 450 pairs in a mixed colony of over 3,000 nests in Australia) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Some populations also show a tendency to breed solitarily or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Outside of the breeding season the species may feed solitarily (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or in small loose groups (Marchant and Higgins 1990) (e.g. of 12-50 individuals) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), although flocks of hundreds or more individuals may form where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) but is most active at dawn and dusk (although in coastal environments it feeding habits are determined by tidal stages) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and roosts at night in trees (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) alongside lakes or rivers or in mangroves, often with other species (Langrand 1990). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits all kinds of inland and coastal wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although it is mainly found along the coast in the winter (e.g. in the Palearctic Region) (Snow and Perrins 1998) or during droughts (e.g. in Australia) (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It frequents river margins, lakes shores, marshes, flood-plains (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), oxbows, streams (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields, drainage ditches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), aquaculture ponds, reservoirs (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and sewage works (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) inland, and the shallows of salt-lakes (Marchant and Higgins 1990), saltpans, mudflats, coastal swamps, mangroves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), saltmarshes, seagrass flats, offshore coral reefs, lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries when in coastal locations (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> In aquatic habitats its diet consists of fish, amphibians, snakes, aquatic insects and crustaceans although in drier habitats terrestrial insects, lizards, small birds and mammals are more commonly taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed from sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and vegetation (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and is normally positioned over water at a height of 1-15 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) in reedbeds, bamboos (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes, trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. willow <em>Salix</em> spp.)<strong>, </strong>mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and other plants near water or on islands in sites that are protected from ground predators (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups where nests may be less than 1 m apart or touching, although they are usually placed more spread out in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding pairs may also reuse nests from previous years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Management information </strong>Breeding site conservation should include colony protection, control of disturbance and vegetation management, and the conservation of feeding areas should include the management of hydrology, salt intrusion, contaminants and disturbance (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

Other populations (e.g. in north-east Asia and North America) are fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds throughout the year in the tropics with different regional peaks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) depending on food availability (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs, even up to 10,000 pairs in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), feeding in loose flocks of 10-20 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Nocturnal roosting sites in Africa commonly hold a few hundred to 2,000 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and open savanna grassland subject to seasonal inundation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), dry arable fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), artificial grassland sites (e.g. lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although in Australia it may enter woodlands and forests, and it shows a preference for freshwater (Marchant and Higgins 1990) although it may also use brackish or saline habitats (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to c.1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or locally up to c.4,000 m (Peru) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter (e.g. palm-nut pulp) may also be taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of twigs and vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and is positioned up to 20 m high in reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), marshes, mangroves, dense thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes or trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually over or surrounded by water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups with the nests placed close or touching (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information</strong> The species can adversely affect the trees and bushes it uses for nesting, which may lead to the abandonment of the colony site if it is not managed (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","Large colonies nesting in urban areas are perceived as a public nuisance and may be persecuted (e.g. by disturbance to prevent colony establishment, removal or direct killing) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

In the south it is more restricted to irrigated oases, palmeries and dry riverbed vegetation (<em>Launaea</em>, <em>Ziziphus</em>, <em>Nitraria</em>, <em>Limoniastrum</em>). In Tunisia it is commonest in cactus growth, orchards and oases whilst in Israel it is most often found in well-vegetated, naturally bushy areas with low scattered trees; palm groves and shrubs bordering fields or water-filled wadis in the Arabian Peninsula.

It tolerates scattered bushes, but avoids extensive bushy cover (Madge and de Juana 2017). In the northern part of its European range it is confined mainly to  cereal fields and hay meadows. In southern Europe it has a broader  habitat array occupying several types of open country, including  grasslands and steppes. During winter it gathers in flocks and may show rather  short distance displacements to favourable feeding grounds, often  fallow or stubble fields (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Bos and van  Noorden 2010, Madge and de Juana 2017). The breeding season starts relatively late,  from late May onward in north-western populations, but probably earlier  in southern populations. The nest is placed on the ground,  hidden among vegetation. It is entirely built by the female. The clutch,  usually four to six eggs, is incubated by the female alone. The  incubation period is 12–14 days. The chicks are fed by the female (with  the male in attendance) and leave the nest after 9–13 often before being  able to fly (Madge and de Juana 2017). The species's diet consists mainly of plant  seeds, but during the breeding season it includes a high percentage of  invertebrates, primarily small insects. The species is  mainly sedentary in the north and west of its range whilst central and eastern European populations are partially migratory. Central Asian birds move south (Madge and de Juana 2017).","The strong decline of the species in north-western Europe is mainly a  consequence of agricultural intensification. Cropped areas of  spring-sown cereals have decreased, mowing of hay has been advanced and  the use of pesticides has increased. Winter food supplies have decreased  as a consequence of the loss of spring tillage, increased pesticide  usage and improved harvesting and storage techniques. The increase of  winter-sown cereal cropland has affected the species adversely through  increased nest losses, as a consequence of early harvesting and the  early ploughing of winter cereal stubble fields (Donald and Forrest  1995, Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Madge and de Juana 2017). The abolition of the  European set-aside scheme is of great concern, not only for birds.  Set-aside has provided valuable food and nesting sites for many farmland  birds whose populations were declining due to agricultural  intensification (BirdLife International 2008). The species may be  vulnerable to climatic extremes along its northern range limits  (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Madge and de Juana 2017).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 18,300,000-31,300,000 pairs, which equates to 36,700,000-62,600,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Autumn passage is from late July to November, with arrival in Northern  Africa mainly late September to early October. Most birds leave Africa  for spring migration in March; crossing Europe from March to early May.  The males typically arrive on the breeding grounds 10–14 days before the  females. The species breeds in open fresh or brackish marshland with  rich or tussocky vegetation, grassy or marshy edges of lakes and rivers,  wet hay fields, swampy meadows and marshy tundra, in forest tundra and  extreme northern taiga zones. The species breeds in general in areas  providing combination of grassy cover and moist soils, rich in organic  matter. Outside breeding season, generally occupies similar habitats,  with more use of man-made habitats, e.g. sewage farms and rice fields,  upper reaches of estuaries and coastal meadows. Its diet includes larval  insects (10–80%), adult insects, earthworms, small crustaceans, small  gastropods and spiders. Plant fibres and seeds are consumed in smaller  quantities. It feeds by vertical and rhythmic probing in substrate,  often without removing the bill from the soil. It typically forages in  small groups. Laying April-June. Monogamous, but both sexes show high  degree of promiscuity. Territorial; densities up to 10–38 (even 110)  pairs/km<sup>2</sup>. Nest usually on dry spot, covered by grasses,  rushes, sedges or sphagnum. High proportion of the nests may be predated  or trampled by cattle (Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2015).","The decline noted in breeding populations of Europe is probably chiefly  due to habitat changes, especially drainage. In Schleswig-Holstein,  northern Germany, a decline was observed from 13,000 pairs in 1970 to  1,500 in 1992. A very high decline of 99–100%, followed the improvement  of marginal grasslands in northern England. Low water levels shorten the  period of food availability in pastures, due to the lower penetrability  of soil, and thereby strongly influence the length of breeding season. Changes in habitat structure and food abundance, which already  negatively affect this (and many other) species might also lead to  increased predation risks for nestlings. Careful manipulation of water levels may allow improvement of breeding  success. Estimated 1,500,000 birds hunted annually in Europe (notably France) (Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2015).","<p>The total population is estimated to number over 4,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2006). The European population alone has recently been estimated at 2,670,000-5,060,000 pairs, which equates to 5,350,000-10,100,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms approximately 35% of the species's global range therefore a very preliminary estimate of the species's global population size would be 15,000,000-29,000,000 mature individuals although further validation of this estimate is needed.<br/></p>",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: The species is listed on Annex II (A) and III (B) of the EU Birds Directive.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: Drainage of freshwater wetland habitats needs to be stopped and reversed.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Palearctic populations of this species undergo extensive post-breeding dispersal movements in all directions and are also fully migratory, travelling southward on a broad front (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) between August and October and returning to the north from March to April (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Other populations (e.g. in the tropics) are resident but may make partial migratory movements connected with fluctuations in water-level (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). In the western Palearctic and India the species breeds mainly between May and July, breeding from June to February in South Africa, or in relation to the rains in tropical Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds singly or occasionally in small loose groups in favourable areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. 2-3 nests were spaced 50 m apart at the same pond, Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). When not breeding the species may be found singly, in pairs (Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), in small flocks of 5-15 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998) (e.g. on migration) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), or roosting in groups of 30 individuals (Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). In most areas it is mainly a crepuscular feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) although it may be diurnal in some regions (e.g. South Africa) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species is most common in freshwater marshes with beds of bulrushes <em>Typha</em> spp., reeds <em>Phragmites</em> spp. (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) or other dense aquatic vegetation, preferably also with deciduous bushes and trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as willow <em>Salix</em> spp. or alder <em>Alnus</em> spp. (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It may also occupy the margins of lakes, pools and reservoirs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), wooded and marshy banks of streams and rivers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), desert oases, peat bogs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), wooded swamps, wet grasslands, rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), rank vegetation around sewage ponds (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005), and in places mangroves, the margins of saline lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and saltmarshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet varies with region and season (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) but it is essentially insectivorous and takes aquatic adult and larval insects such as crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and beetles (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Other food items include spiders, molluscs, crustaceans (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. shrimp and crayfish) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), fish, frogs, tadpoles, small reptiles and birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed from reeds and twigs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and is normally placed near open pools<strong></strong>in thick emergent vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (such as beds of bulrushes <em>Typha</em> spp. or reeds <em>Phragmites</em> spp.) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) close to the surface of the water or up to 60 cm above it (Snow and Perrins 1998). Alternatively nests may be placed in low bushes or trees (e.g. alder <em>Alnus</em> spp. or willow <em>Salix</em> spp.) up to 2 m above water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Preferred nesting sites are usually 5-15 m out from the shore in water 20-30 cm deep (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species usually nests singly but may nest in loose colonies in favourable habitats with neighbouring nests as close as 5 m apart (solitary nests are usually 30-100 m apart) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Nests are often reused in consecutive years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","The following information refers to the species's European range only: Since 1970, European populations have fallen, most likely due to habitat destruction and pollution, however these alone do not explain its decline. In Belgium, the species has suffered from pollution and the drainage of wetlands and in the Netherlands building construction has disturbed nesting habitat. High mortality during migration and in the wintering quarters has been attributed to the European declines. Droughts in Africa have led to desertification and loss of wetland areas, which extends the trans-Saharan crossing (Tucker and Heath 1994). Recreational activities such as fishing and swimming are also a threat as is the intensive commercial use of water areas (e.g. reed cutting, fish farming), river regulation measures and eutrophication (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species may also be affected by fires (San-Miguel-Ayanz <em>et al</em>. 2009).","The global population size has not been estimated owing to recent taxonomic splits.&#160;The European population is estimated at 63,100-111,000 pairs, which equates to 126,000-222,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms approximately 20% of the global range so a very preliminary estimate of the global population would be 630,000-1,110,000 mature individuals although further validation of this estimate is needed.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Northern populations of this species are migratory, with those breeding in the western Palearctic travelling on a broad front across the Sahara (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and those breeding in North American travelling on a narrow front along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Post-breeding southward movements occur from September to October and return northward movements occur from March to May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Tropical populations are not migratory but may undergo seasonal post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). In temperate regions breeding occurs in the local spring, with tropical and subtropical nesting generally coinciding with the rains (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests in small numbers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in single- or mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although sometimes groups may reach several thousand pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). When nesting within mixed-species colonies the species tends to form monospecific clusters (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species's aggregatory behaviour outside of the breeding season varies much throughout its range, some populations (e.g. in America) remaining highly gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998) and gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands to roost (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), others (e.g. Palearctic breeders) being largely solitary except when roosting or on migration (Snow and Perrins 1998) (roosting flocks of 2-6 to 200 are known in Africa (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1992) and small flocks occur on migration) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is largely crepuscular and nocturnal, but may feed diurnally especially during the breeding season (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits fresh, brackish or saline waters with aquatic vegetation and bamboo or trees (e.g. pine, oak or mangroves) for roosting and nesting in (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), showing a preference for islands or predator-free areas for nesting sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occupies the forested margins of shallow rivers, streams, lagoons, pools, ponds, lakes, marshes and mangroves and may feed on pastures, reservoirs, canals, aquaculture ponds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and rice-fields (up to 96 % of a colony's food resources may be taken from nearby rice-fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On migration the species may also frequent dry grasslands or marine coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), kelp beds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). It breeds up to 4,800 m (Chile) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) but is more common at elevations of up to c.2,000 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> It is an opportunistic feeder taking fish, frogs, tadpoles, turtles, snakes, lizards, adult and larval insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and dragonflies) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, leeches, small rodents, bats and the eggs and chicks of other bird species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is platform constructed of sticks and vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) placed 2-50 m above water or on dry ground near water (Snow and Perrins 1998) in trees, bushes, reedbeds, on cliff ledges (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (overhanging rivers) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) and on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in protected sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests close together in single- and mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with as many as 20-30 pairs in the same tree (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Colony sites may be reused in consecutive years or flocks may move to new sites (usually such movements are a result of nesting trees being destroyed due to the colony's nesting activities) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Colony sites are dispersed throughout the landscape in relation to distance from feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).  <strong>Management information</strong> A study carried out in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992). The creation of a network of new nesting sites spaced at 4-10 km in relation to available foraging habitats in zones currently without suitable nesting sites is also recommended (Fasola and Alieri 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland drainage and destruction (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and by drought in wintering areas (Hafner and Kushlan 2002). It is highly susceptible to pesticides (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kwon <em>et al.</em> 2004, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) such as organophosphates, carbamates (Kwon <em>et al.</em> 2004) and DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) which negatively affect hatching success (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). There are also cases of genetic damage to chicks as a result of petroleum contamination (Custer 2000). The species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and Newcastle disease so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). It is also persecuted (anti-predation killing) at aquaculture facilities due to its depredation on fish stocks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and has suffered declines due to the exploitation of chicks from nesting colonies in the past (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Utilisation</strong> Chicks of the species are still taken for food in some areas (e.g. Madagascar) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Hafner 200) and adults are hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The global   population is estimated to number c.570,000-3,730,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 60,000-86,100 pairs, which equates to 120,000-172,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;National population estimates include: c.100,000-1   million breeding pairs, &gt;c.10,000 individuals on migration and   &gt;c.10,000 wintering individuals in China; c.100,000-1 million breeding   pairs in Taiwan; c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 wintering   individuals in Korea and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000   individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: A study carried out in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992).

The timing of breeding varies geographically, occurring all year round (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or coinciding with the rains in the tropics (Johnsgard 1993) and peaking between April and June in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).

It is usually a solitary feeder (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982) but may form large fishing flocks in some areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It also roosts communally at nesting sites or in major feeding areas and flies in flocks of varying sizes (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982).

Feeding is exclusively diurnal.<strong> Habitat</strong> The species frequents both coastal and inland habitats (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Johnsgard 1993, Snow and Perrins 1998, Nelson 2005). In marine environments it occurs in sheltered coastal areas on estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), saltpans, coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Johnsgard 1993), mangrove swamps, deltas (Johnsgard 1993) and coastal bays (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982), requiring rocky shores, cliffs and islets for nesting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) but generally avoiding deep water and rarely extending far offshore (Snow and Perrins 1998). It also inhabits fresh, brackish or saline inland wetlands (Nelson 2005) including lakes, reservoirs, wide rivers, flood waters (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), deep marshes with open water, swamps and oxbow lakes (Johnsgard 1993), requiring trees, bushes, reedbeds or bare ground for nesting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and avoiding overgrown, small, very shallow or very deep waters (Nelson 2005). <strong>Diet</strong> The species' diet consists predominantly of fish, including sculpins, Capelin, gadids (Gremillet et al 2004) and flatfish (Leopold et al 1998) as well as crustaceans, amphibians (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), molluscs and nestling birds (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982). At sea the species preys mostly on bottom-dwelling fish, occasionally also taking shoaling fish in deeper waters (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is a generalist, having been shown to feed on at least 22 different fish species (Gremillet 1997). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest varies from a depression (Nelson 2005) to a platform of sticks, reeds and seaweed (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). On the coast the species nests on inshore islands, cliffs, stacks, amongst boulders and occasionally on artificial structures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), also nesting inland on trees or bushes, in reedbeds or on bare ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species usually nests in mixed-species colonies, often re-using sites and nests from year to year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Foraging range </strong>The Great Cormorant has a largely neritic distribution. At sea, it rarely wanders far from the coast, preferring sheltered areas and estuaries where it normally feeds in shallow water. It preys mainly on benthic fish species. It is rarely observed to dive below 10 m (BirdLife International 2000, Petersen et al 2003, Gremillet et al 2004) although it has been recorded down to -35 m (Gremillet et al 2004). Several studies have shown that this species is able to forage up to 20-25 km from its wintering roosts or breeding colonies. Most foraging trips are confined to within 10 km of the colony (Gremillet 1997, BirdLife International 2000, Petersen et al 2003), but trips up to a 35 km radius have been recorded (Gremillet 1997). Off the coasts of eastern Jutland and at Læsø, Denmark, 75% of recorded birds were seen within 3 km of the coast (Petersen et al 2003). Preferred habitats include granitic boulder, since this is the favoured habitat of labrids, the commonest prey in the diet (Gremillet 1997). The species is also likely to select sandy areas with a high abundance of flatfish or rocky substrates where gobies, wrasse, sea scorpions and small gadoids occur (BirdLife International 2000).","Due to the species' foraging behaviour (shallow diving) and habit of hunting within purse-seine and gill-nets, the species is particularly susceptible to bycatch. Although, these unintentional effects of fishing activities are not currently found to be driving colony declines, they could present problems on both local and global scales if populations were to decline (Bregnballe and Frederiksen 2006).","The global   population is estimated to number c.1,400,000-2,100,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 401,000-512,000 pairs, which equates to 803,000-1,020,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"This species has an extremely large distribution, being found on every continent except South America and Antarctica.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Juveniles, and to a lesser extent adults (Mateo <em>et al.</em> 1998), are prone to irregular nomadic or partially migratory movements throughout the species's range in response to water-level changes (Snow and Perrins 1998, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) or food availability (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Members of the Palearctic population are partially migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and regularly travel to warmer regions in the winter via favoured stop-over sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (non-breeders may be present all year round in the wintering areas) (Snow and Perrins 1998, Amat <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the Mediterranean and West Africa, breeding colonies appear to be linked by a significant frequency of juvenile and adult dispersal and are thus considered to belong to a single metapopulation (Balkiz 2006). Members of the Asian populations move from their breeding sites at inland lakes to coastal wetlands during non-breeding periods (Balachandran 2007), and when not breeding the sub-Saharan African population tends to disperse among the alkaline-saline lakes and wetlands of eastern and southern Africa (McCulloch <em>et al.</em> 2003, Baker <em>et al.</em> 2006). The Palearctic population breeds regularly from March to June in large dense single-species colonies of up to 20,000 pairs (occasionally up to 200,000 pairs) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and in some regions may undergo a post-breeding flightless moult period where adults gather in flocks on inaccessible waters (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). The Asian and sub-Saharan populations breed irregularly following the rains, often in large mixed colonies with Lesser Flamingo <em>Phoeniconaias minor</em> (Brown and Root 1971, McCulloch and Irvine 2004, Balachandran 2007). The species is gregarious and commonly occurs in flocks of 100 or more outside of the breeding season (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), with thousands often flocking together (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) in areas rich in food or at freshwater inlets of saline or alkaline lakes to drink and bathe (Snow and Perrins 1998). In sub-Saharan Africa, the species may also join large flocks of non-breeding Lesser Flamingo. The species is a bottom feeder (Snow and Perrins 1998) and forages both by day and night (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), feeding by filtering particles through tiny platelets in the bill (Snow and Perrins 1998). It also often roosts at night in large flocks (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits shallow (c.1 m deep over a large area) (Snow and Perrins 1998) eutrophic waterbodies (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) such as saline lagoons, saltpans and large saline or alkaline lakes (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) up to pH 11 (Snow and Perrins 1998). It will also frequent sewage treatment pans, inland dams (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005), estuaries (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and coastal waters (Diawara <em>et al</em>. 2007), seldom alighting on freshwater but commonly bathing and drinking from freshwater inlets entering alkaline or saline lakes (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). It nests and roosts on sandbanks (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), mudflats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), islands (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) or boggy, open shores (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists of crustaceans (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (especially brine shrimp <em>Artemia salina</em>) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), molluscs, annelid worms, larval aquatic insects, small fish, adult terrestrial insects (e.g. water beetles, ants), the seeds or stolons of marsh grasses, algae, diatoms and decaying leaves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It may also ingest mud in order to extract organic matter (e.g. bacteria) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The species nests in large dense colonies on mudflats or islands of large waterbodies, occasionally also on bare rocky islands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), with a distance between neighbouring nests of between 20 and 50 cm (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is usually an inverted cone of hardened mud (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) with a shallow depression on the top (alternatively it may be a small pile of stones and debris when mud is not available) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Management information</strong> The removal of sand polluted with lead shot from a salt-lake in Cyprus was successful in significantly reducing the numbers of deaths due to lead poisoning (Miltiadou 2005). At two colonies (one in France and one in Spain) management techniques to counteract erosion and the lack of suitable nesting islands were successfully applied in order to encourage breeding by the species (Martos and Johnson 1996).","The species suffers from low reproductive success if exposed to disturbance at breeding colonies (Ogilvie and Ogilvie 1986, Yosef 2000) (e.g. from tourists, low-flying aircraft [Ogilvie and Ogilvie 1986] and especially all-terrain vehicles [Yosef 2000]), or if water-levels surrounding nest-sites lower (resulting in increased access to and therefore predation from ground predators such as foxes and feral dogs) (Miltiadou 2005). The lowering of water levels in lakes can also lead to hyper-salinity which may affect food resources (Nasirwa 2000). Other threats to the species's habitat include effluents from soda-ash mining (Nasirwa 2000, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005), pollution from sewage and heavy metal effluents from industries (Nasirwa 2000). The species also suffers mortality from lead poisoning (lead shot ingestion) (Mateo <em>et al.</em> 1998, Miltiadou 2005), collisions with fences and powerlines (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005), and from diseases such as tuberculosis, septicemia (Nasirwa 2000) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974). <strong>Utilisation</strong> In Egypt large numbers of adults are shot or captured to be sold in markets (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), and egg collecting from colonies occurs in some areas (this may become a threat) (Ogilvie and Ogilvie 1986).","The overall population is estimated at 550,000-680,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 45,000-62,400 pairs, which equates to 89,900-125,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"This species is regularly seen from West Africa eastward throughout the Mediterranean to South West and South Asia, and throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersal movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and are considerably nomadic (Snow and Perrins 1998). In addition northern breeding populations are fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and may travel on a broad front (e.g. across the Sahara) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Northern and southern breeding populations breed during the local spring, whilst breeding elsewhere coincides with the rains (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species nests in mixed-species colonies, either in small groups (e.g. 5-100 pairs in Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) or in large aggregations of thousands of pairs, and during the winter or dry seasons the species usually forages in small flocks (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of up to 30 indivduals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). It often roosts communally at night in large groups (sometimes thousands of individuals) with other species, occasionally in trees far from wetland feeding sites (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species feeds in very shallow water (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) and nests in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes) and low trees or bushes (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It shows a preference for marshes at the edges of lakes and rivers (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), as well as lagoons, flood-plains, wet meadows (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), swamps (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), reservoirs (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), sewage ponds, rice-fields and irrigated cultivation (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It less often occurs in coastal locations such as estuaries, deltas, saltmarshes (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) and coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Roosting sites are often large trees that may be far from water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> The diet of the species varies seasonally depending on what is available (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It takes adult and larval insects (e.g. aquatic beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and caddisflies), worms, leeches, molluscs (e.g. snails and mussels), crustaceans (e.g. crabs and crayfish) and occasionally fish, frogs, tadpoles, lizards, small snakes and nestling birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a platform of twigs and vegetation usually positioned less than 1 m above water (occasionally up to 7 m) in tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes), low trees or bushes over water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) through drainage (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian <em>et al</em>. 2002), clearing, grazing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It is also threatened locally by hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998), disturbance and pesticides (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global population is estimated at 230,000-2,220,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

Some dispersive movements in Africa are also related to seasonal rains and the appearance of temporary wetlands (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species breeds in solitary pairs, the timing of breeding varying geographically and depending on the growth of emergent vegetation and water-levels (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). After breeding the species undergoes a flightless wing-moulting period during which it may assemble in loose groups (Fjeldsa 2004) (up to 700 individuals) (Snow and Perrins 1998) in rich feeding areas (Fjeldsa 2004). During the winter the species is largely solitary or occurs in small groups of 5-30 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits a wide range of small and shallow wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) usually less than 1 m deep (Fjeldsa 2004) with rich vegetation (floating, submerged and emergent) and high densities of aquatic invertebrates, generally avoiding waters with large predatory fish (Konter 2001). Suitable habitats include small lakes, ponds, the sheltered bays and vegetated shores (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) of larger freshwater, alkaline or saline lakes (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and reservoirs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), slow-flowing rivers (Konter 2001), canals (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), flood-plain oxbows, coastal brackish lagoons (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), seasonally inundated areas, swamps (Fjeldsa 2004), gravel pits (Santoul and Mastrorillo 2004), sewage lagoons (Fjeldsa 2004) and rice-fields (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Outside of breeding season it is common on more open waters and is occasionally observed along the coast in estuaries or sheltered bays protected from strong wave action (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). When moulting, the species requires rich feeding areas (Fjeldsa 2004). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects, especially mayflies, stoneflies, water bugs, beetles, flies, caddisflies and dragonflies, as well as molluscs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (e.g. freshwater snails) (Fjeldsa 2004), crustaceans, adult and juvenile amphibians (e.g. small frogs and newts) and occasionally small fish (up to 11 cm) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) during the winter (Konter 2001). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a floating platform of aquatic plant matter (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) anchored to emergent vegetation (Fjeldsa 2004), submerged branches or bushes close to the edge of shallow wetlands (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Management information</strong> In France it was found that the presence of aquatic macrophytes was the most important factor in attracting the species to new artificial habitats (such as gravel pits) (Santoul and Mastrorillo 2004).","The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of this virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).&#160;In Europe numbers often fluctuate, mainly as a result of winter conditions, such as the marked decline in Britain after the cold winter of 1962–1963, and similarly in the Netherlands after that of 1984–1985.

During the breeding season it favours well-spaced mature trees to younger trees and bushes, and thus has adapted well to avenues, parks, gardens, orchards and other man-made habitats, as well as occupying many types of deciduous or coniferous woodland. It is also found at woodland edges, in forest glades, clearings and burnt patches, and in trees along streams, rivers and edges of standing water. The breeding season in Europe is from mid-May to mid-August, mainly May-June farther east and April-July in north-west Africa. The nest is a bulky cup of loosely piled fine twigs, rootlets, dead leaves, pieces of decaying bark, moss, dry grass, lichens and fibres, bound with hair and lined with hair, feathers and finer material. It is sited above the ground on a natural or artificial ledge, in a niche, at the base of a basket-shaped tuft of twigs against a tree trunk, in a hole in a tree, branch or stump, in creeper against a tree or wall, or on top of a flat branch.

Clutches are typically four of five eggs. The diet is made up of invertebrates, berries and seeds. The species is migratory and travels on a broad front across the Mediterranean and Sahara to winter in the African Sahel (Collar 2015).","Since 1970 the species has declined in western Europe, most likely due to drought in its wintering quarters and agricultural intensification, as well as afforestation and abandonment of low-intensity farming (Collar 2015).

Although it is common throughout much of its range, population size estimates and trends are unknown. There are no specific threats recorded for this species, nor are there any specific conservation actions in place. Further research should be done across the range of this species, to ensure regional populations are stable and ample high-quality habitat remains to support the viability of this species. Due to the widespread nature of this species and the lack of specific threats, <em>V. atalanta</em> is assessed as Least Concern. </p>","<p><em>Vanessa atalanta</em> can be found in many open habitats including moist fields, marshes, city parks and gardens, and along streams (Opler and Wright 1999, van Swaay <em>et al</em>. 2010). In the summertime, in the southwest U.S., it retreats to higher elevation montane habitats, avoiding the warmer temperatures of the lowlands below (Brock 2008). Larval host plants include members of the family Urticaceae, such as Nettles (<em>Urtica spp</em>.) and Pellitory (<em>Parietaria spp.</em>) (Opler and Wright 1999).&#160;</p><p>Flight season and voltinism vary regionally for this species (Opler and Wright 1999). In the northern climes of the United States, the flight season is March to October, and there are generally two generations per year (Opler and Wright 1999). <em>V. atalanta</em> cannot survive freezing temperatures, so migrates south or to lower altitudes in the fall (Opler and Wright 1999). In Europe, migrants arrive to the Mediterranean region in October and early November when the availability of their local host plant, <em>Urtica dioica</em>, is at its peak (Cuadrado <em>et al</em>. 2017). They spend the winter breeding, and the next generation heads north after hatching in the early spring. By July and August, they are absent form their wintering grounds (Cuadrado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Due to warmer temperatures in Europe over the last few decades, the timing of this spring migration is becoming earlier, with some individuals overwintering and breeding as far north as the UK (Fox and Dennis 2010). Similarly, in California, seasonal timing to adulthood has advanced by an average of almost 30 days, due to warmer temperatures (Forister and Shapiro 2003).</p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk17800425"">There are no known threats impacting this species across the entirety of its range.

In Europe, it occupies open scrubby country where bushes and shrubs of different height, and/or low man-made structures such as stone walls, fence lines, telephone wires and field posts, sit within or adjacent to flat or rolling terrain with uneven herb-rich substrate. It also inhabits alpine moorland, heathland, grassy hillsides, dry plains, bush-studded pastures, woodland edge, sandy forest clearings, field margins and fallows, wide shrubby riverbeds, open garrigue with&#160;<em>Cistus</em>, unkempt marshy areas, swamp fringes, roadsides and railway margins and vineyards.<br/><br/>The breeding season is from March to mid-August in north-west Europe and from the end of April to late July in eastern Europe across Asia to Japan, but from mid-May in northern Russia, April-August in the Himalayas, February-June in Morocco, March in Senegal, April in Sierra Leone, January in Nigeria and March in Cameroon,&#160;December-March in Bioko, August-September in southern Democratic Republic of Congo, April-May in Sudan and Ethiopia, February-March in Uganda, January-June (mainly March-May) in Kenya, September-February in northern Tanzania and August-November in southern Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia, July-December (mainly August-November) in Zimbabwe, August-December in South Africa and September-December in Lesotho. The nest is a loose deep cup of rootlets, grass, leaves and plant stems, lined with finer rootlets and sometimes hair, wool and feathers. It is set on the ground or in a low bank, well hidden at base of tuft of herbage or in the bottom of or under a small bush. Clutches are usually four to six eggs. The diet is primarily invertebrates, mainly small or medium-sized insects and their larvae but it occasionally takes small vertebrates, seeds and fruit (Collar 2015). The species varies from migratory to resident in different parts of its range, being sensitive to cold weather (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Declines in Europe since the 1950s have been driven by a loss of breeding habitats due to agricultural intensification (Collar 2015), including the creation of large open fields, destruction of bushes and hedges, transformation of pastures to arable fields, the afforestation of fallow and moorland and the destruction of structurally diverse vegetation by uncontrolled fire and human disturbance (Tucker and Heath 1994). It has also suffered from the withdrawal of grazing from littoral heaths in Europe (Collar 2015). Severe winters have also caused populations to fluctuate (Tucker and Heath 1994).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;5,790,000-9,310,000 pairs, which equates to 11,600,000-18,600,000 mature individuals&#160;(BirdLife International 2015).

Previously, Red Kite was listed as Near Threatened because of a suspected moderately rapid population decline, owing mostly to poisoning from pesticides and persecution, and changes in land-use amongst other threats. However, these declines have been more than compensated by increases in the majority of countries within its range, at a rate that means that declines over the past three generations have been overcome. There are still declines in southern Spain, Portugal, and locally in Germany and perhaps France, and the species has recently been lost as a breeding species in Morocco. Poisoning (both deliberate and accidental) remains the greatest threat to continued population growth and threatens the persistence of the species regionally, especially in southern Iberia. However, overall the data indicate that the global population has increased by more than 30% over the last three generations and the species is assessed as Least Concern.<p></p> <p></p>","The species breeds in broadleaf woodlands and forests, mixed with farmland, pasture and heathland, up to 1,600 m in Switzerland (A. Aebischer <em>in litt. </em>2016) and formerly possibly to 2,500 m in Morocco<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo<em> e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1994). In winter it also occupies wasteland, scrub and wetlands. Formerly an urban scavenger, it still visits the edges of towns and cities and is now frequent in suburban areas where they will visit gardens (Orros &amp; Fellowes 2014). It takes a wide range of food, but feeds mainly on carrion and small to medium-sized mammals and birds. Reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are less important prey.<br/><br/>Many birds in north-east Europe are migratory, wintering mainly in southern France and Iberia, but with some travelling as far as North Africa<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo<em> et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1994). Migrants travel south from their breeding grounds between August and November, returning between February and April (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, but sometimes form small flocks when soaring on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) or at open waste disposal sites. The availability of high density reliable food provided by landfill managed in certain ways may influence the degree to which kites are sedentary in an area (Evans and Pienkowski 1991): high availability of roadkill may also influence movement decisions.&#160;<br/><p></p>","The most pertinent threat to this species is illegal direct poisoning  to kill predators of livestock and game animals (targetting foxes, wolves, corvids etc.) and indirect poisoning from pesticides and secondary poisoning from consumption of poisoned rodents by rodenticides spread on farmland to control vole plagues, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, where it may drive rapid population declines<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(e.g. see Villafuerte <em>et al. </em>1998, Mougeot <em>et al. </em>2011, A. Aebischer <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>. </em>2009); there has been reported a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Carter 2007). An estimate of 430-1,800 individuals killed illegally in Spain annually indicates that this remains a significant problem for birds that do migrate and for the regional population (Brochet <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(J. Vi<span lang=""ES"">ñuela <em>in lit<em>t</em></em><em>.</em> 2009). The total of recovered, confirmed poisoning cases in Spain is 1,187 individuals found dead between 1992 and 2015 (Cano&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;In north  Scotland, 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 were found to have been  killed by poisoning (Smart <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(P. Tourret <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to  chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological  impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Schaub<em>&#160;</em>2012, P. Tourret <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009); 18 Red Kite were located having been killed by collisions with windfarms in 2019 (F. David <em>in litt. </em>2020). Other less significant threats include electrocution and collision with powerlines<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong></strong>(Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>,&#160; hunting and trapping (Mionnet 2007, P.

Another factor implicated in the declines in France and Spain is a decrease in the number of rubbish dumps<strong></strong> (Mionnet 2007, Cardiel and Viñuela 2007)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","Recent data submitted to the European Commission for EU countries (which hold at least 90% of the global population) estimated a total of 29,746- 34,751 pairs breeding in 17 countries (BirdLife International in prep.), closely matching a new global estimate of <em>c.</em> 35,000 pairs (A.

The global population is therefore estimated to be between 60,000-70,000 mature individuals. <br/><br/>This is a substantial increase from the numbers previously reported: 25,200-33,400 pairs for the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015), and 21,000-25,000 pairs in 2009.",Increasing,"This species is endemic to the western Palearctic, with the European population of 32,200-37,700 pairs, which equates to 64,400-75,400 mature individuals from an area encompassing more than 95% of the breeding range (A.

It is now only a winter visitor in small numbers to Morocco, having recently become extinct as a breeding species (Radi <em>et al. </em>2020). Its status as a breeding and wintering species in North Africa is now uncertain. <br/><br/>The largest breeding populations are now in Germany (14,000-16,000 pairs), the U.K. (4,388 pairs), Sweden (3,100-4,100 pairs), France (3,000-3,900 pairs), Switzerland (2,800-3,400 pairs) and Spain (2,312-2,440 pairs) (BirdLife International in prep., Knaus <em>et al. </em>2018). These six countries together now hold over 90% of the global population, indicating a shift in the core abundance of the species towards central and northern Europe, with conservation reintroductions contributing to some of this shift (Stevens <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species previously suffered a moderate to rapid decline, and the population overall declined by almost 20%&#160;during 1990-2000 (BirdLife International 2004). In&#160;Germany, the population is now stable (Gerlach&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019), though with regional variation (increases in the south and west, but stable or declining elsewhere [Grüneberg and Karthäuser 2019])&#160;and it is estimated the population is currently still 16% lower than&#160;in the late 1980s. Eastern German populations declined by 25-30% between 1991 and 1997, but then stabilised&#160;(Mammen 2000, Mammen and Stubbe 2002)<strong></strong>, whereas in the federal state Saxony-Anhalt the decline continued until 2006 (Mammen 2007). The populations of the northern foothills of the Harz Mts (the most densely populated part of its range) suffered an estimated 50% decline from 1991-2001 (<strong></strong>Nicolai and Weihe 2001)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>There is little consolidated data to judge the extent of declines in France during the last century, but comparing counts from 1980 and 2000 suggests a decline of up to 80% in some areas, during which time the species's range in France decreased by 15%<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(A. Mionnet&#160;<em>in litt</em><em>.</em>&#160;2005, Thiollay and Bretagnolle 2004)<strong></strong>. A national survey conducted in 2008 revealed a decline of more than 20% of the French breeding population over 6 years (David and Mionnet 2010), with the breeding population declining from 3,000-3,900 pairs in 2002<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong><strong></strong>(Mionnet 2007)<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>to 2,335-3,022 pairs in 2008 (Pinaud&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2009).&#160;The trend for the French population between 1998 and 2011 was estimated to be decreasing by 25% (BirdLife International 2015); however the trend now appears stable or even increasing locally (F. David&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). <br/><br/>In Spain the declining trend continued in the breeding population to the census in 2014, with the three generation population reduction using data from the 1994 and 2014 censuses being 44% (Molina 2015). Much of this decline is in the south, and the species is at risk of extirpation from Doñana National Park (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2019). The Balearic Islands population declined from 41-47 breeding pairs in 1993 to 27 in 2004<strong></strong>&#160;(Cardiel 2006); however, conservation actions have since enabled the population to recover, to 38 breeding pairs in 2007<strong>&#160;</strong>(Cardiel<em>&#160;in<em>&#160;litt</em></em><em>.</em>&#160;2007) and this trend has continued (Molina&#160;2015). A rapid decline is also thought to have occurred in Portugal, but without quantification except for a reported 50% reduction in the occupied area (H.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory, the main routes of migration being along Arctic coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998). It arrives on the breeding grounds in early-June where it may breed in small, loose colonies or dispersed in single pairs (especially in the high Arctic where the habitat is unsuitable for large groups) (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). There is a high degree of synchrony in egg laying and hatching, with the adults moulting c.10 days after the young hatch (mid-July to mid-August) during which they become flightless for c.21-30 days (Johnsgard 1978; Scott and Rose 1996). Most individuals moult near the breeding grounds although immatures, unsuccessful breeders and some more southerly breeding groups may undertake pre-moult migrations and form large moulting concentrations well-away from nesting areas (Johnsgard 1978; Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984; Scott and Rose 1996). After the post-breeding moult flocks leave the breeding grounds in early-September with some arriving in wintering areas as early as mid-September, others making stopovers on route and arriving later (Madge and Burn 1988). The species leaves its wintering quarters again from mid-March to mid-April (Madge and Burn 1988). During the non-breeding season the species remains gregarious, gathering in groups of only a few to several thousands of individuals, although it is rarely found in very large flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in coastal Arctic tundra in or close to wet coastal meadows with abundant grassy vegetation and on tundra-covered flats with tidal streams (only just above the high tide line) (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). In some parts of its range it shows a preference for nesting on small grassy islands in tundra lakes and rivers, especially if nesting Sabine's Gulls <em>Xema sabini</em>, Snowy Owls <em>Bubo scandiaca</em>, Peregrine Falcons <em>Falco peregrinus</em> or large raptors are present to deter predators (Johnsgard 1978; Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984; Madge and Burn 1988; Kear 2005). High Arctic nesters may also breed widely dispersed over icy tundra, well-away from water (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species becomes predominantly coastal, inhabiting estuaries, tidal mudlflats, sandy shores, coastal saltmarshes (especially in the spring) and shallow muddy bays (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005). In recent years the species has taken to grazing on coastal cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields, but rarely occurs on freshwater wetlands except on passage (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996). <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species is mainly herbivorous although it may take animal matter (e.g. fish eggs, worms, snails and amphipods) (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <em>Breeding</em> In its breeding habitat the diet of the species consists of mosses, lichens, aquatic plants, sedges, tundra grass <em>Dupontia</em> spp., arrowgrass <em>Triglochin</em> spp. and saltmarsh grass <em>Puccinellia</em> spp. (Alaska), although the young may also take insects and aquatic invertebrates (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species predominantly takes marine microscopic and macroscopic algae (e.g. seaweeds, <em>Ulva</em> spp.) and other aquatic plants linked with saline or brackish waters in the intertidal zone (e.g. especially eelgrass <em>Zostera</em> spp., as well as <em>Ruppia maritima</em>, <em>Spartina alterniflora</em>, <em>Salicornia </em>spp., and arrowgrass <em>Triglochin</em> spp.) (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). <br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow depression on the ground (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Although the species often nests close to water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) typically within a few hundred metres of the tideline, high Arctic nesters may breed on icy tundra well away from water (some nearly up to 10 km inland) often near boulders where the snow clears first (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Management information </strong>An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on dry, improved grasslands that had high abundances of the grass <em>Lolium perenn</em>e, were between 5 and 6 ha in area, and were at a distance of up to 1.5 km inland or 4-5 km along the coast from coastal roosting sites (Vickery and Gill 1999). The species was found to show a preference for grasslands with short, dense swards c.5 cm in height, a characteristic that can be gained through summer management plans involving either mechanical cutting, livestock (sheep or cattle) grazing regimes, or cutting and then grazing (although over longer periods of time the selective grazing of sheep rather than cattle, and frequent rather than infrequent cutting may be more likely to enhance tillering and produce the short, dense sward favoured by this species) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Fertilising the grassland with nitrogen in the autumn at a rate of 50 kg N/ha was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 21% compared with unfertilised areas, and fertilising at a rate of 75 kg N/ha was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 9-29% and to remove any preference the geese showed for short sward heights (between 5 and 11 cm) (Vickery and Gill 1999). In other fertilising experiments grazing intensity of the species was found to increase linearly with increasing levels of fertiliser (from 0 kg N/ha to 150 kg N/ha), although responses in grazing intensity at fertiliser levels lower than 50 kg N/ha were found to be short-lived (c.2 months after fertiliser application) (Vickery and Gill 1999).","This species is threatened by hunting (Kear 2005). In its winter range the species may be persecuted by farmers, as in recent years it has increasingly taken to grazing on cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields near the coast (Scott and Rose 1996). It is further susceptible to disturbance from vehicles, although it is  relatively tolerant of human disturbance, e.g. walkers, compared to  other species (Vickery and Gill 1999; Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002<em></em>). Habitat within the breeding range is degraded through the expansion of industrial developments (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/>The species may also be threatened in the future by reductions in food supplies following the return of a disease of the eelgrass <em>Zostera marina</em> (a staple food) (Scott and Rose 1996).&#160;It can use alternative feeding sources as demonstrated following the collapse of eelgrasses in the Netherlands (1930-1940), but these need to be highly nutritious and diverse.&#160;It has been shown that nest success is dependent on fat reserves that have been acquired in the staging areas (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995). <br/>The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic fox <em>Vulpes</em> <em>lagopus</em> predation (Madsen <em>et al</em>. 1992), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Inbreeding depression has also been identified as a threat to current population growth (Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2011). Nevertheless, these threats seem to have little or no impact on the overall population size. <br/>The species however appears susceptible to climate variability, with the probability of breeding being negatively correlated to the sea surface temperature (Sedinger <em>et al</em>. 2006); hence climate change may lead to a reduction in reproductive success in the future.","The global   population is inferred to number 490,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2020). The European population is estimated at 1,500-1,800 pairs, which equates to 3,000-3,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,,"The species is hunted in large parts of its range, mainly for recreation and sport (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2020).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>The species is mainly resident, but its northernmost populations in North America, Scandinavia and Russia migrate south between September and November, returning in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998). Soaring flight is used frequently (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is always seen singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It inhabits mature woodland, particularly coniferous, but also deciduous or mixed, preferring areas near clearings and the forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds and mammals make up the vast majority of its diet, with grouse, pheasants and partridges being especially important in boreal zones (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built on the forks or branches of large trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994), typically in areas with high (60-90%) canopy closure (Squires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). <strong>Management information </strong>The species's optimal habitat appears to be areas of farmland interspersed with mature forest; afforestation has improved its status across parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Significant declines in Europe in the 19th-20th centuries are thought to have resulted from persecution and deforestation, with later declines in the 1950s-1960s a result of poisoning from pesticides and heavy metals. Studies on Northern Goshawk nestlings in Norway show that persistent organic pollutants are still present in plasma, preen oil and feathers, suggesting recent and continuous exposure (Briels <em>et al. </em>2019). Persecution continues to be a threat, as is nest robbing for falconry (Orta and Marks 2014). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind farm developments (Strix 2012). Timber harvest is a primary threat to nesting populations, with nests and nest stands regularly destroyed or by logging operations, but the impact on breeding success is unknown (Squires <em>et al</em>. 2020, Byholm <em>et al. </em>2020). Disturbance caused by logging activity near nests can also cause nest failure (Boal and Mannan 1994). In Alaska, U.S.A, clear-cut, even-aged, short-rotation forest management reduces habitat quality for the species, as does removal of old growth forest patches (Iverson <em>et al</em>. 1996). Increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in western North America are causing a reduction in suitable roosting and foraging sites (Blakey <em>et al. </em>2020). Declines in some European countries are associated with reduced food supply following intensification of farming and forestry and increased competition for nest sites from Eagle Owls <em>Bubo bubo</em>&#160;(Rutz <em>et al. </em>2006).","The European population is estimated at 234,000-380,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International In prep.). Europe forms approximately 26% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of global population size is 900,000-1,460,000, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

In Italy it is still threatened by illegal shooting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001)&#160;and in other countries where Skylarks (<em>Alauda arvensis</em>) are hunted (Gustin <em>et al</em>. 2000). In Europe, habitat loss through urbanisation, modification of agricultural practices, construction of roads, open-cast mining, agricultural expansion into steppe and grasslands and afforestation has caused a reduction in hunting areas and prey species. It also suffers from human disturbance, such as rock-climbers, pesticides, electrical powerlines and interspecific competition with Peregrine Falcon (<em>Falco peregrinus</em>) (Gustin <em>et al</em>. 2000; Di Vittorio <em>et al. </em>2017; De Rosa <em>et al. </em>2019). Local declines in southern Africa have possibly been associated with seed dressings, and whilst the overall effects of pesticides are unknown they have been shown to have negative impacts locally (Kemp 1994, Global Raptor Information Network 2015).

It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.","The species breeds in open lowlands with trees and plenty of insects and small vertebrates, on which it feeds, including steppe and forest-steppe, open woodland, cultivation and pastureland with tall hedgerows or fringing trees, agricultural areas with shelterbelts and, in the north-east, boggy areas and taiga edge. It is usually colonial, breeding in disused nests of other birds (most commonly <em>C. frugilegus</em>), but can also be solitary. It is found from sea-level to c.300 m in the west, but to 1,500 m in Asia (Ferguson-Lees <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 2001)<strong></strong>. It is often crepuscular (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is migratory, with birds travelling great distances to their wintering grounds in southern Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Most leave their breeding grounds in August and September, making the return journey between February and June, with a peak in May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, P. Palatitz <em>in litt. </em>2016). Birds migrate in a broad front across the Mediterranean Sea, not concentrating at bottleneck sites to the extent that many other raptors do (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998), although individuals from Eastern populations can aggregate in large numbers (e.g.&#160;Fehérvári <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;On migration, they form mixed flocks often over 100 strong with other falcons such as <em>F. naumanni</em>, and tend to stay at very high altitudes for the majority of the journey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The bulk of the population overwinters in the Kalahari region, but exact distributions may vary year to year depending on precipitation, which affects insect abundance (P. Palatitz <em>in litt. </em>2016). Before the northwards migration it may gather at stopover sites, and returns to the breeding grounds via West Africa and South and East Europe, creating a migration loop (P. Palatitz <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><p></p>","At the breeding grounds, the greatest threats are loss and degradation of foraging habitats and loss of nest sites (Palatitz <em>et al. </em>2009). Intensification of agriculture has resulted in conversion of natural habitats to agricultural fields and a decrease in extensive grassland management, especially grazing, reducing the availability of suitable foraging habitats (Palatitz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Widespread use of pesticides further affects food supply (Ferguson-Lees&#160;&amp; Christie&#160;2001). This species primarily uses rookeries for colonial nesting throughout their breeding range, therefore threats that affect Rooks (<em>Corvus frugilegus</em>) also affect Red-footed Falcons. The Rook population has declined in many areas due to logging of rookery trees, disturbance and persecution (Ferguson-Lees&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2001; Anon. 2007; Palatitz <em>et al. </em>2009; BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Even in areas where Rook populations are stable, some rooks have shifted to nesting in urban habitats (Palatitz <em>et al. </em>2009). This has forced the Red-footed Falcon to change its nest site selection habits, becoming heavily dependent on artificial nest boxes in some areas (Fehérvári&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008; Palatitz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008, 2015). As productivity is generally greater in larger colonies, further decreases may occur in the absence of conservation efforts (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001).

Birds tend to migrate on broad fronts, but there are concentrations in Gibraltar and along the Rift Valley (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Nevertheless it will readily migrate over expanses of water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Birds tend to hunt alone, although do gather at high prey concentrations and will roost in groups of often over 50, sometimes communally with <em>C. macrourus</em> and <em>C. aeruginosus </em>(Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).&#160; <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a bird of open country, usually in lowlands but occurring up to 1,500 m in central Asia, and on its African wintering grounds up to 4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds and mammals form the majority of its diet; voles are a particularly dominant food source locally in abundant areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> It nests in tall vegetation on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>Tall vegetation must be left during the breeding season, with high rates of chick mortality when this is harvested on agricultural land; key management practices include moving nestlings to safe places during harvesting, and leaving areas unharvested around the vicinity of nests (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994).","In the past, the use of organochlorine pesticides seemed to cause a decline in Europe and probably to a lesser extent also in Africa (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).&#160;<br/><br/>Currently, the main threat in its breeding range is the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land, an environment in which crop gathering by combine harvesters causes frequent breeding failure in the species through nest destruction by farm machinery and increased risk of predation by native species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Berger-Geiger <em>et al. </em>2019). Intensification on this land increases this threat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), as does the increasing tendency for earlier harvest dates (Berger-Geiger <em>et al. </em>2019).

The species has also been found to breed in agricultural areas, at least when agriculture is non-intensive (Terraube <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2009). A minority of the population breeds in the boreal forest and forest-tundra zones, north of its main breeding range (Kuznetsov 1994, V. Morozov<em> in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, where it nests in clearings and other open areas (Galushin <em>et al. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Mosaics of forest/ shrubland and grassland and, to a lesser extent, agricultural land, are used in winter (Liminana <em>et al. </em>2015). The species is migratory, with most birds wintering in sub-Saharan Africa or south-east Asia. They leave their breeding grounds between August and November and return in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Birds migrate on a broad front, with only minor concentrations at bottleneck sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Record numbers during migration were counted at Batumi, along the Black Sea Coast of Georgia, where up to 2,500 birds were annually counted in autumn during 2008-2018 (Vansteelant <em>et al. </em>2019). Although birds are most often seen singly, females and juveniles can form parties of 10-15 individuals on migration (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds fly at c.1-9 m above the ground when hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998) and fly generally higher on migration, but tend to remain from c.1-15 m above the ground (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982).  <p></p>","Within its breeding range, the species is primarily threatened by the destruction and degradation of steppe grasslands through conversion to arable land, burning of vegetation, intensive grazing of wet pastures and the clearance of shrubs and tall weeds (Galushin <em>et al. </em>2003, E. Bragin <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Fires are started by farmers, arsonists and dry thunderstorms<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(E. Bragin <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 2007). 	<br/><br/>On its wintering grounds, the species is thought to be negatively affected by the loss and degradation of grassland due to conversion to agriculture, burning, cutting, overgrazing, excess harvesting of trees and shrub encroachment as a result of changes in pastoral activities (Galushin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003; Limiñana&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). The species's nomadic nature may allow them to find alternative areas, however suitable habitat is fragmented, therefore this may be energy intensive (Limiñana&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). The species may also be affected by the use of harmful pesticides, rodenticides and other toxic chemicals (R. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Galushin <em>et al. </em>2003), although this requires more research. The distribution of overwintering Pallid Harriers is associated with climatic variables (particularly rainfall), therefore climate change may also pose a threat (Limiñana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).<br/><br/>On migration, one of the main threats is illegal bird shooting - over 10% of the European population of Pallid Harriers may potentially be illegally killed each year in North and Central Europe and the Caucasus region, representing over 1% of the global population (Brochet <em>et al. </em>2019). For example at Batumi on the Black Sea Coast and south to Eastern Turkey, where the largest numbers of migrating birds are counted annually, a large number of birds are regularly killed (Batumi Raptor Count; A. Corso <em>Terra</em> 2019).<p></p>","The global population is estimated at 9,000-15,000 pairs (Galushin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003), equating to 18,000-30,000 mature individuals.&#160;The European population is estimated at 1,000-2,200 breeding pairs, which roughly equates to 2,000-4,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds primarily in the steppes of Asiatic <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and north-west <strong>China</strong>.

Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds in September and October, wintering from France south as far as sub-Saharan Africa, and east as far as the Middle East (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). They begin their return journey in February and March, arriving in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is generally on a broad front, although there is some concentration at a few sites (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Hundreds of birds occasionally gather at roosting sites, sometimes with other harriers such as <em>C. pygargus</em>, but otherwise they are usually solitary, associating only temporarily at especially rich feeding sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They have a slightly greater tendency to be gregarious while on migration but the above still generally applies. Birds fly c. 10-30 m above the ground (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species inhabits extensive areas of dense marsh vegetation, in fresh or brackish water, generally in lowlands but up to 2,000 m in Asia and 3,000 m on its wintering grounds in Cameroon (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> It is a generalist predator taking a variety of prey types, with small birds generally preferred but mammals such as voles, rabbits and rats being more important in parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a pile of reeds built in dense marsh vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> The species requires extensive wetland in its breeding range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).</p>","<p>Main threats include wetland desiccation and drainage; persecution by shooting; pollution, especially from excessive pesticide use in and around wetlands (although widespread bans have reduced this threat somewhat), and poisoning by heavy metals, notably the consumption of lead-shot through feeding on contaminated waterbirds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species increasingly breeds and hunts in farmland, therefore loss of prey through agricultural intensification may pose an increasingly significant threat (Keller <em>et al. </em>2020). Molins-Delgado <em>et al. </em>(2017) found evidence for high levels of UV filters (used in sunscreens) in unhatched eggs of Western Marsh-harrier in Spain, which may have endocrine-disrupting effects. The historical threat of hunting in southern Europe has mostly subsided, but illegal shooting is still rife locally, notably on Malta (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). High levels of persecution have also been reported in Iraq (Al-Sheikhly &amp; Al-Azawi 2019).

Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009, Sanz-Aguillar <em>et al. </em>2015b) and the Balkans (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2016). Declines in parts of Africa are likely to have been driven by loss of  wild ungulate populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock and improvements in slaughterhouse sanitation<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016). The population crash in the Cape Verde Islands has been attributed to a rise in mortality due to the former use of long-lasting pesticides (some of which, although now illegal, are still easily bought and used), the ongoing poisoning of stray dogs, and a decrease in food availability due to urbanisation, rural abandonment and better sanitation (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2020).<em>&#160;</em>Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional ""<em>muladares</em>"" in Spain and Portugal<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Donázar 2004, J. C.

Similarly, closures of over 300 small rubbish dumps in Oman as part of an upgrade in waste management may reduce food availability (S. Al Touqi, cited in McGrady <em>et al. </em>2018), although a study in Turkey found no short-term effect on reproductive success of closure of rubbish dumps (Katzenberger <em>et al. </em>2017). In parts of the range where transhumance occurs, there may be asymmetries in food availability at different times of year (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2018). However, recently passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers and guidelines about how to operate them exist&#160;(A. Brunner<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al.</em> 2010), and in eastern Europe dietary diversity has no effect on population sizes, but instead could affect territory size (Dobrev&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poisoning is a significant threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009, Cortés-Avizanda <a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623""><em>et al</em>. 2009, 2015 Sanz-Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2016</a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a>), and through the consumption of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries including Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted potential contamination of Egyptian Vultures that may lead to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease&#160;(e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008]).&#160;<br/><br/>It appears that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International 2008), is driving the recent rapid declines in India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2012, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2014). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by <em>Gyps</em> spp. vultures<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). This drug has recently been approved for veterinary use in Europe, and is commercially available in France and Spain, which is a major concern for the species (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2007a) and &#160;potentially risky in other regions of Spain (<a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623"">Donázar and Benítez <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span></a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a> 2007, Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and in Africa (Nikolaus 1984, 2006), with 17 individuals found killed by electrocution in Port Sudan, over 10 days in&#160; 2010 (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2010, Angelov <em>et al. </em>2013a), indicating a potentially serious problem that has persisted for decades and will continue to contribute to Egyptian Vulture population declines. In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (<em>Gyps fulvus</em>) may reduce breeding success<strong><sup> </sup></strong>in the short-term (Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008). <span style=""font-style: italic;""><p></p></span>","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;3,000-4,500 breeding pairs, equating to&#160;6,100-9,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms 25-49% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 12,400-36,000 mature individuals, roughly equating to 18,600-54,000 individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occupies a large range with isolated resident populations in the<strong> </strong>Cabo Verde and Canary Islands in the west (although they may still have some connectivity to the continental population&#160;[Agudo <em>et al. </em>2011]), through <strong>Morocco</strong>&#160;(Amezian and Khamlichi 2015) and parts of West Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie&#160; 2001). A small resident population persists in <strong>Angola</strong> and <strong>Namibia</strong>. The bulk of the resident population occurs in <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and East Africa, Arabia and the Indian Subcontinent, while Saharan and Sahelian parts of Africa in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Algeria</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Niger,</span> northernmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cameroon, Chad</span> and northern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span> also hold significant but presumably smaller populations (I.

These birds winter within the resident range, and in addition throughout the Sahel region of Africa. Global population estimates for the species are crude, but 3,000-4,500 pairs are estimated in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep</em>), &lt; 2,000 pairs in central Asia, just a few thousand pairs now in the Indian Subcontinent,  perhaps 1,000 pairs in the Middle East, and perhaps 1,000-2,000 pairs in Africa (Thiollay 1989, I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).&#160;The population size in Europe is estimated to have decreased by 50-79% in 53.4 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;In Spain, which with c.1,300 pairs may support as much as 40% of the European breeding population, the number of territories declined by at least 25% between 1987-2000 (i.e. equating to a decline of &gt;50% over three generations)<sup><strong> </strong></sup>(Donázar 2004, Del Moral 2009), likely due to high mortality rates (Cortés-Avizanda <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The Spanish population was estimated to be stable for the period 1998-2011 (BirdLife International 2015, Tauler <em>et al. </em>2015), and the adjacent French population appears to be increasing (Lieury <em>et al.</em> 2015), although 2015 appeared to be a bad year there (Vulture Conservation Foundation 2016). Balkan populations are however still declining at 4-8% per year, with the population in <strong>Greece</strong>&#160;having declined by 44-60% over 30 years&#160;(Xirouchakis and Tsiakiris 2009, Grubač&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Velevski <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declines are reported from the Middle East<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(S. Aspinall <em>in litt.</em> 2005), e.g. 50-75% in <strong>Israel</strong>, however in <strong>Oman</strong> the population appears stable or increasing&#160;(J. Eriksen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2005, Al Bulushi <em>et al. </em>2013, Angelov <em>et al. </em>2013b), although this may be more a reflection of count methods rather than genuine stability in the population. Around 1,900 birds are resident in a stable population on the island of Socotra (Porter and Suleiman 2012). The resident populations within Africa have declined by 5.9% per year over the past 29-36 years &#160;(Ogada <em>et al.</em> 2016), including those in Ethiopia and <strong>Djibouti<sup> </sup></strong>(G. Mulholland <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Arkumarev&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014), Kenya (Virani <em>et al. </em>2011),&#160;and Angola and Namibia (where just 10 pairs remain)<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(R.

The species has gone Extinct in the region of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Taylor <em>et al. </em>2015), and is Extinct as a breeding species in Namibia (Simmons 2015).&#160;Most critically, the species has undergone a catastrophic decline (&gt;35% per year) since 1999 in India, where numbers detected on road transects declined by 68% between 2000 and 2003<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006), but the recent ban on Diclofenac may have arrested the decline of the Indian population (Galligan <em>et al</em>. 2014).<em><p></p></em>","In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W.

The veterinary drug diclofenac has now been banned by the Indian government. In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). &#160;Due to the recent legalisation of diclofenac for veterinary use in the EU, there is an active campaign against the use of diclofenac in the European Union (http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/project/ban-veterinary-diclofenac). An International species action plan for the species was published in 2008 (Iñigo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). National species action plans are in place in France, Bulgaria and Italy, and the species is included in the Balkan Vulture Action Plan (BVAP). Efforts are being taken to release captive-bred individuals in parts of Italy. In Spain, France, Italy, Bulgaria and Macedonia birds have been fitted with satellite-tags to study juvenile dispersion, migratory movements and wintering areas (e.g. García-Ripollés <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2015). Nest guarding schemes for pairs that are most threatened by poachers have been implemented in Italy and Bulgaria, where very small populations survive (Zuberogoitia<em> et al.</em> 2014, Oppel<em> et al. </em>2016). Expeditions to study the limiting factors in the wintering areas and along the migration flyway have taken place together with local organizations in Mauritania, Senegal, Ethiopia, Sudan and Turkey (Arkumarev <em>et al.</em> 2014, Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2014). A training seminar was held in Ethiopia to help build capacity for conservation of the species on its African wintering grounds (Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds 2013). A LIFE-Nature project in the Canary Islands has significantly enhanced adult and sub-adult survival through actions including education campaigns, control of illegal poisoning and modification of power lines (Badia-Boher <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian vultures was published in 2017 (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and an international Flyway Action Plan for the Central Asian and Balkan populations was initiated in 2015 in Bulgaria, encompassing the Balkans, Central Asia, Middle East, and East Africa (S. Oppel <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species is considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Uganda (WCS 2016).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Start and maintain intensive cooperation with local stakeholders to ensure poison- and poaching-free zones at sites with high densities or congregations of the species throughout the breeding, migration and wintering range, alongside similar efforts for other threatened species. Build capacity in countries along the migration flyways and in the wintering areas. There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). Research threats, monitor populations and protect key sites along migratory pathways and bottlenecks along the Red Sea Flyway (Buechley <em>et al. </em>2018). Protect nest sites where persecution is a problem. Research the causes and extent of current declines across the species's range. Insulate dangerous electricity pylons in areas where high mortality is recorded.  Coordinate monitoring to assess trends throughout the range. Relax the European Union sanitary regulations in relation to carcass disposal. Establish supplementary feeding sites based on rigorous scientific knowledge and under adaptive and appropriate management (Moreon-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al. </em>2016). Raise awareness amongst pastoralists of the dangers of using diclofenac for livestock<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. Effectively reduce risks of poisoning through strict enforcement of poison-bait ban and education. Lobby for the banning of diclofenac for veterinary purposes throughout the species's range, and support the enforcement of this ban where it has been adopted. Where applicable, establish the impact of wind turbines, and lobby for effective impact assessments to be carried out prior to their construction. Where  appropriate, guard nests to reduce disturbance. Confiscate illegally  kept live birds and use them for the purposes of captive breeding and  future restocking and reintroduction programmes. In key areas of the  species's range, implement long-term and large-scale education and  community involvement programmes. The Flyway Action Plan for the conservation of the Egyptian Vulture in Central Asia and the Balkans (2017) additionally highlighted: the need to improve detection methods and better understand the causes of poisoning and illegal killing; legislation and enforcement to mitigate illegal killing; raise awareness of illegal killing; mitigate electrocution and collisions with energy infrastructure; raise awareness amongst planners and developers of dangerous energy infrastructure; monitor breeding pairs, productivity and success rate; protect breeding sites and foraging habitats; and ensure a successful <em>ex situ</em>&#160;Egyptian Vulture endangered species programme.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Information suggests the population has declined rapidly across the majority of its range, and is projected to continue to decline, and it is therefore classified as Vulnerable.","This species requires well-vegetated eutrophic to neutral swamps, marshes, lakes and slow-flowing rivers with areas of open water and abundant emergent fringing vegetation. It also breeds on saline, brackish and soda lakes and occasionally even in sheltered coastal bays (Kear 2005). The breeding grounds are reoccupied from early March (in the south) to early May (in Siberia) (Scott and Rose 1996) with breeding starting from April-May. During the winter the species frequents similar habitats to those it breeds in, including large lakes, slow-flowing rivers, reservoirs, brackish waters, marshes, weirs (Africa) and flooded gravel pits (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Fox <em>et al</em>. 1994, Scott and Rose 1996).&#160;The nest is a depression or shallow cup in a thick heap of vegetation positioned on the ground in shallow water&#160;(Johnsgard 1978,&#160;Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992,&#160;Snow and Perrins 1998,&#160;Kear 2005).&#160;As in the breeding season, the species will shift to coastal habitats such as brackish lagoons, tidal estuaries and inshore waters (where it may associate with sewage outfalls [Kear 2005]) when driven by frost or other compelling factors (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species has been recorded to 2690 m in Ethiopia (Ash and Atkins<em>&#160;</em>2009).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of seeds, roots, rhizomes, the vegetative parts of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants as well as aquatic insects and larvae, molluscs, crustaceans, worms, amphibians and small fish&#160;(Johnsgard 1978,&#160;Brown&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1982,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992,&#160;Marsden and Bellamy 2000,&#160;Kear 2005).<br/><br/>Northern populations of this species are highly migratory (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Those breeding in the milder parts of western or southern Europe are sedentary or only make short-distance movements, often in response to harsh weather conditions (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), although individuals from some areas, such as France may utilise mulitple localities up to 200 km apart in one winter (Keller <em>et al. </em>2009, Gourlay-Larour <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;<strong></strong>","<p>It is thought that the primary factors that have led to the decline in this species are most likely to be a combination of: (i) loss of breeding habitat in eastern Europe, and (ii) changes in water chemistry (especially from hyper-eutrophication caused by agricultural runoff). The loss of habitat is thought to primarily result from changes in land management; either the abandonment or intensification of management of lowland marshes and fish ponds (Fox<em> et al.</em> 2016).&#160;The abandonment of traditional lowland grazing marshes results in succession to scrub and other unsuitable habitats, whilst greater agricultural intensification leads to marshes being drained. Negative changes to fish pond management also arise from either a reduction in fish production or an intensification that leads to greater use of fish food and medication treatments, and an increase in nutrient inputs (Fox <em>et al. </em>2016).</p>The species suffers from predation and nest predation by several introduced and native mammals including American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;(Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003), Raccoon Dog <em>Nyctereutes procyonoides,&#160;</em>Raccoon <em>Procyon lotor</em>, Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> and Wild Boar <em>Sus scrofa</em>. Increased predation levels may be partly related to declines in Black-headed Gull <em>Chroicocephalus ridibundus</em> colonies, with which Pochard often associate for the benefits of predator deterrence; pochard breeding in association with gull colonies apparently benefit from elevated breeding success and female survival (Fox&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Väänänen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Invasive carp&#160;<em>Cyprinus carpio</em> may also provide competition for resources with this species, and have been shown to negatively impact the Pochard (Maceda-Veiga <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;<br/><br/>The species may also be threatened by disturbance from hunting (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992; Evans and Day 2002; Kear 2005; Balmaki and Barati 2006; Sorrenti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; H. Ibrahim&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), water-based recreation (Fox&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Kear 2005) and from machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000). Pochard are permitted for hunting in several eastern European states, which selects for breeding females and naïve juveniles (Fox <em>et al., </em>2016).&#160;The European hunting bag for the Pochard remains high in proportion to declining populations across the Continent (Hirschfeld <em>et al.,</em>&#160;2019). Brochet <em>et al., </em>(2019) estimates 30,000 birds are illegally killed/taken per year in North &amp; Central Europe and Caucasus, 5% of the population here, with Azerbaijan responsible for the largest number. This amounts to an estimated 2% of the global population. Eggs have also been sold in the UK. Adults are poisoned by ingesting lead shot (Spain) (Mateo <em>et al</em>. 1998), with one estimate that it accounts for the death of 56,511 Pochard in Europe each year (Andreotti <em>et al. in press</em>); and drowned in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm (China) (Quan <em>et al.</em> 2002). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Emerging threats include climate change and changes to sex ratios. Pochard have a narrow ecological niche, particularly with respect to water conditions which are sensitive to climate change. For example, Jeppesen <em>et al.,&#160;</em>(2015) highlighted how climate change can synergistically act with water abstraction, leading to salinity increases at wetlands and leaving them unsuitable for Pochard. There is also evidence of an increasingly male-biased sex ratio (Brides <em>et al. </em>2017), believed to be due to increasing female mortality (suggestions for this include&#160;migration stress, and greater predation hunting risk during the breeding season) which may be contributing to global population declines.","The global population is estimated to number 760,000-790,000 mature individuals, which equates to 1.14-1.18 million individuals in total (Wetlands International 2021). Three flyways are identified, with the following population estimates: North-East/North-West Europe with 100,000 mature individuals (150,000 total); Central &amp; NE Europe/Black Sea &amp; Mediterranean with 350,000 mature individuals (530,000 total); Western Siberia/South-West Asia with 310,000-330,000 mature individuals (460,000-500,000 total).&#160;The European breeding population is estimated at 89,700-151,000 pairs, which equates to 179,000-302,000 mature individuals or c. 270,000-450,000 total individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).",Decreasing,"The species breeds from western Europe through central Asia to south-central Siberia and northern&#160;<strong>China</strong> (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It is present throughout the year but may make within-winter movements. European migratory populations winter mostly in north-western and western Europe, the eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, as well as in <strong>Turkey</strong>, the Middle East and as far south as sub-Saharan Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997,&#160;Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).

The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the U.K. attracted nesting pairs to the area by causing an increase in invertebrate food availability and an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes. The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994). In the Trebon Basin Biosphere Reserve, Czech Republic, it was found that artificial islands and wide strips of littoral vegetation are the most secure breeding habitats that can be created for the species (nest survival in littoral habitats was improved by reduced nest visibility, increased water depth, and increased distance from the nest to the habitat edge, and nest survival on islands was improved with increased distance to open water) (Albrecht&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). The use of lead shot in Europe is being phased out, and there is now a CMS resolution for global action (R.

The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size reduction criterion (criterion A). The probability of extinction has not been calculated for this species, therefore criterion E cannot be applied. The population size is very small, and approaches the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criteria C and D. However, the population size has only increased and exceeded the threshold for Endangered under criterion D within the past five years.

It is found in pinewoods at 700-1,800 m with a high proportion of broom&#160;<em>Chamaecytisus proliferus</em>&#160;in the understorey - Inagua's orography imposes an altitudinal restriction of c. 1300 m.&#160;Highest habitat suitability is found within stands with more than 21m of pine height, tree cover between 35%-55%, and summer rainfall between 13-20 mm (Carrascal <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;&#160;Although Canary pine seeds constitute its main food source, birds occasionally feed outside pinewoods during severe weather, and invertebrates are an important food source during the breeding season.<br/>The breeding season lasts from April to early August. Breeding success is low, with only ca. 1.5 fledglings per successful nesting attempt, and 1.4 clutches per breeding season (Rodríguez and Moreno 2008), estimated to be between 54% and 65% (Carrascal&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160; The main cause of breeding failure is predation, mostly by the Great Spotted Woodpecker <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dendrocopos major.&#160;</span><p></p>","The main causes of decline in the past were habitat destruction and fragmentation due to land use change, and collection of specimens for natural history museums. Currently, wildfires, increasing in frequency and magnitude, are considered their greatest threat (Delgado <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021). This was seen most recently in 2007, when significant areas were destroyed, including at the most important site at Inagua, leading to a 50% reduction of the population. Recent fires in September 2017 and August 2019 degraded part of the potential colonisation habitat in La Cumbre and Tamadaba, and another forest fire in February 2020 broke out in areas occupied by the species in Inagua. Mature pine forests are also suffering forest dieback as a consequence of climate change (Martin <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), where models predict increases in temperature and a decrease in precipitation over the next century (Expósito <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Protected areas are heavily used for recreation and leisure on Gran Canaria, and this may cause disturbance. Inbreeding may also be a significant threat (Barov and Derhé 2011)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It suffers from being captured and kept in cages, and possibly also still from illegal trade, primarily to Italy, Germany and Belgium, which may have an effect on population levels. Its pinewood habitat has been subject to intense commercial exploitation which has resulted in habitat fragmentation and population isolation. The main cause of breeding failure is predation, mostly by the Great Spotted Woodpecker&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dendrocopos major&#160;</span>(Rodríguez and Moreno 2008). Other predators include sparrowhawks (<em>Accipiter nisus</em>), feral cats (<em>Felis catus)</em>, long-eared owl (<em>Asio otus</em>) and potentially raven (<em>Corvus corax</em>). The common kestrel (<em>Falco tinnunculus</em>) and the rat (<em>Rattus</em> sp.) could also prey on nests, although there are no direct observations that confirm this (Delgado <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021).","The population size is estimated to be 430 individuals, with 362 at Inagua (36 km<sup>2</sup>) and 68 at La Cumbre (21 km<sup>2</sup>) (Carrascal <em>et al., </em>2019), estimated from breeding surveys, suggesting a total population of 645 individuals. These form part of the same subpopulation, as colour-marked birds from Inagua were first found breeding at La Cumbre, before&#160;captive-reared birds were released there to reinforce the wild population. Population density estimates vary: apart from the two years following the 2007 forest fire, densities in Inagua have remained stable, around 10 birds /&#160;km²&#160;(Moreno <em>et al., </em>2018), with the highest recorded density of 17.7 chaffinches /&#160;km² in 2019 (Carrascal <em>et al., </em>2019).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>The species is fully migratory, leaving its Mediterranean breeding grounds in October and November to winter in Madagascar, East Africa and the Mascarene Islands. The return journey begins in late April and May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Birds are known to fly as high as 1,000 m during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). They are generally gregarious (though sometimes solitary), tending to move in small and loose flocks, and on migration often associating with other species flying at high altitudes, including <em>F. subbuteo</em> (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They hunt mainly at twilight (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Habitat</strong> Birds usually breed and stop over on small islands and islets, wintering mainly in open woodland on Madagascar (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> It feeds on large flying insects and small birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Birds nest in the holes and ledges of sea cliffs, or on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> The species appears to require very peaceful or uninhabited islands on which to breed, with direct exploitation and development both shown to be negative consequences of close proximity to people; effective protection has led to strong recoveries where implemented (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>The species has historically suffered from exploitation and persecution brought about by local people, including collecting chicks for food, although this practice has declined significantly (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). Human disturbance associated with tourism development has also been shown to negatively influence birds’ breeding success (Martínez-Abrain&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Orta and Kirwan 2014), and is present throughout much of the breeding range (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Disturbance and habitat degradation brought about by overgrazing and intensification of agriculture is a threat in many breeding areas (Ristow 1999; pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Predation by rats and cats is also important on many breeding islands (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Touati <em>et al. </em>2017). Accidental pesticide poisoning was thought to be responsible for a decline in the breeding population on Crete (Ristow and Xirouchakis 2000; Ristow 2001). The species is vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (STRIX 2012; Kassara <em>et al. </em>2019). Deforestation and persecution may be threats in the wintering grounds, however the impact of these is unknown (Ristow 1999). Climate change is also predicted to have a significant effect on this species, for example through increased incidence of wildfires causing deterioration of foraging habitat; a shift in the timing and distribution of autumn passerine migration affecting prey availability during the peak breeding season; a shift in both breeding and wintering range leading to reduced habitat availability and increased exposure to threats; and increased drought conditions limiting water availability at breeding sites and food availability during migration (Kassara <em>et al. </em>2019; Fric <em>et al. </em>2019)</p>","In Europe (which   covers &gt;95% of the breeding range), the population is estimated at 14,200-14,500 pairs, which equates to 28,400-28,900 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).

A national action plan is established in Italy and regional action plans are in place in Spain. The species is also included in an Action Plan for the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Madagascar. Monitoring programmes exist in most European countries at a national level and in protected areas in Greece, Spain and Cyprus (Barov and Derhé 2011). Private research on the species has been conducted on an archipelago off Crete for three decades, in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg and the area became an SPA in 1997 (Ristow 1999). An EU LIFE Nature project, ‘Conservation measures for&#160;<em>Falco eleonorae</em>&#160;in Greece’ was set up in 2003, which met with much success performing the first ever global population census of Eleonora’s falcon, undertaking many public awareness campaigns, and reducing nest predation through rat eradication programmes. Another LIFE project, 'Conservation measures to assist the adaptation of <em>Falco eleonorae </em>to climate change' was set up in 2013. The Conservatoire du Littoral has been coordinating, since 2005, an international programme for the promotion and assistance for the management of Mediterranean insular micro-spaces, known as the PIM Initiative for the Mediterranean Small Islands, which is financed by the Fonds Français pour l’Environnement Mondial (FFEM) (French Global Environment Facility), the Agence de l’eau Rhône Méditerranée-Corse and the City of Marseille. This programme has supported monitoring programmes in Tunisia and Morocco, where the species has been monitored for a long time in its main colony in the Essaouira islands (Qninba et al. 2016). Research on the species has been conducted in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A net expansion of the species has been observed in Morocco thanks to the end of the direct persecutions (Rguibi et al. 2012a). In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a strategy for conservation of birds of prey (https://www.iucn.org/news/mediterranean/202001/first-steps-towards-a-moroccan-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Effective actions to protect coastal areas should be implemented and Environmental Impact Assessments conducted on all developments in coastal areas.

There is a general tendency for a more southerly distribution during the non-breeding season and a more northerly distribution during the breeding season. It is highly gregarious post-breeding and during the non-breeding season when it occurs in large monospecific flocks of up to 2,000 individuals, and potentially &gt;5,000 individuals (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Green<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.&#160;</span>2002, Kear 2005, A.

Nests are sometimes built in close proximity to one another, although they become increasingly spaced out as population density declines (Kear 2005,&#160;<strong></strong>Green 2007). Nesting has been recorded from mid-April to late June, and broods from mid-April to mid-September, this species being a later breeder than coexisting duck species (Green <em>et al. </em>1999, Kear 2005). The species exhibits drastic population fluctuations, partly in response to annual variations in rainfall.&#160;<strong><br/>Habitat&#160;</strong><em>Breeding&#160;</em>It is adapted to temporary, unpredictable, Mediterranean-type wetlands<strong></strong><strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green 2000, 2007)<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>and breeds in fairly dry, steppe-like areas on shallow freshwater, brackish or alkaline ponds with well vegetated shorelines, and rich emergent and submergent vegetation (Green 1993, Kear 2005, Sebastián-González <em>et al</em>. 2013). It also breeds on delta marshes where receding waters leave behind large areas of shallow water with abundant sedges and bulrushes&#160;<strong></strong><strong></strong>(Johnsgard 1978). In addition it may use slow rivers and saline coastal lagoons, and man-made wetlands including fish-rearing ponds, small reservoirs and sewage farms (Green 1993, Y. Perlman&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2013, Y. Artzi <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Although it favours brackish wetlands, it tends to avoid waters of high salinity. Microhabitat requirements are strongly influenced by diet.&#160;<em>Non-breeding</em>&#160;It uses similar habitat during the non-breeding season, although may make more use of shallow, mixed zones of emergent and saltmarsh vegetation during the summer (Sebastián-González&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).<strong> <br/>Diet </strong>The diet varies considerably between seasons and sites and additionally with age. Diptera are an important component of the diet, especially before and during the breeding season. Small seeds become increasingly important after the breeding season with faeces of post-breeding birds in Türkiye composed of 95% dry weight&#160;<em>Scirpus</em>&#160;seeds<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green and Selva 2000, Green and Sánchez 2003, Fuentes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. Newly hatched chicks are highly dependent on emerging chironomids<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green 2000).<strong> <br/>Breeding site</strong>&#160;Nests are usually constructed on the ground at the water's edge, beneath a covering of vegetation (Green 1993, Kear 2005). They may also occur above water in&#160;<em>Typha</em>&#160;stands and are reported to have been found in the roofs of reed huts (Hawkes 1970, Kear 2005<strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. Mean clutch size was recorded in Spain to be 11.8<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green 1998).<p></p>","Over 50% of suitable habitat may have been destroyed during the 20th century. Wetland drainage for agriculture and dam construction occurs across its range, most significantly in Iraq, where the species is threatened by fluctuating water levels and local water shortages. Hydrological work, eutrophication and introduction of carp and other alien species has severely affected breeding sites in Tunisia, Türkiye, Morocco and Spain (A. Green <em>in litt. </em>2020). Reed-cutting, reed-burning and grazing commonly reduce the amount of  habitat for nesting. Pollution from agricultural, industrial and  domestic sources is a threat at many sites. Human disturbance and  urbanisation is also increasing within the species' range (M. Houhamdi <em>in litt</em>. 2022, K. K. Pierre <em>in litt</em>. 2022). A lack of habitat following hot, dry summer months probably results in  high juvenile and adult mortality post-breeding (Green 2000, 2007). Lack  of water availability for the El Hondo reservoirs in Alicante, high  fish densities and illegal hunting have led to a major decline in  eastern Spain since 1998 (Ballesteros <em>et al. </em>2008, A. Green, <em>in litt. </em>2020).  The passage of individuals between Spain and the north of Africa has  been obstructed by the degradation of several wetlands in the Maghreb  region, leading to decreases in the arrival of birds in the Iberian  Peninsula.<br/>In Iraq, the species is also threatened by illegal hunting and persecution, exacerbated by it being the principal wildfowl target for hunters during the summer months (Salim 2010). Brochet <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2019) estimated that 5,000–15,000 individuals are illegally killed/taken per year in the Arabian Peninsula, Iran and Iraq; this is approximately 17% of the global population. Hunting has also been attributed to declines in Pakistan (Chaudhry <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Also in Pakistan, extensive netting operations occur in winter to supply the subsistence on duck meat by locals (Chaudhry <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). When breeding, the species is vulnerable to shooting and egg collection.<br/> Further mortality results from birds caught in fishing nets, lead poisoning, and disease (Mateo <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kear&#160;2005, Svanberg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Increasing spring temperatures (and subsequent fires; K. Hafezi <em>in litt</em>. 2022) and decreasing winter precipitation can negatively impact this species whilst drought can cause further disruption to water levels (M. Amezian <em>in litt</em>. 2022).","There are estimates of the species four flyway populations as follows: west Mediterranean and west Africa 6,000-7,500 individuals, Eastern Mediterranean 20-100 individuals, south-west Asia 46,000-50,000 individuals, and South Asia <em>c.</em> 5,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2022). However, a number of these have no recent information and to incorporate uncertainty larger bounds are used here. For example, data for the south Asian wintering population dates from&#160;between 1987-1991: there are no recent records of large numbers from the area comparable with this number in the past decade. Updated values used are: west Mediterranean and west Africa 7,500-10,000 individuals, east Mediterranean 150-250 individuals, south-west Asia 7,000-50,000, and south Asia 350-1,000 individuals.&#160;<br/><br/>For the west Mediterranean and west Africa population count totals in winter have reached 7,435 individuals in 2017 (Nagy and Langendoen 2020), implying that the true number is somewhat higher than this given the large area of unsurveyed habitat across north Africa. The population size range is expanded here to 7,500-10,000 individuals, but it is noted there is the potential for it to be considerably higher.<br/><br/>There is considerable uncertainty in the size and trends of the south west Asia population, which is largely concentrated in the Mesopotamian marshes of Iran and Iraq. In 2010 winter counts over southern Iraq observed <em>c.</em> 44,000 individuals, possibly due to birds concentrating at single sites as a result of changes in water levels elsewhere in its range (Salim 2010). Subsequent changes to water availability across the region means that deriving national population estimates is difficult, and the significance of recent, much lower counts is uncertain. Fewer than 100 individuals were found between 2015-2016 surveys of Hor Al-Dalmaj and a maximum of 110 individuals were observed at Sawa Lake (Abed&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;Across the larger area between 2014 and 2018, 4,373 individuals were recorded (based on the highest annual IWC count; Wetlands International 2022), but there has been a subsequent single site count of 5,000 individuals during August-September 2021 in Hur al-Azim, Iran (which is connected to the wetlands of southern Iraq) (K. Hafezi&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2022). The partially nomadic behaviour of the species makes it difficult to assess to what extent this reflects redistribution of birds particularly due to natural fluctuations in its population numbers every year (F. Botella&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2022). Accounting for those in countries further north, the minimum bound for the south west Asian population is likely to be between 7,000 and 50,000 individuals.&#160;<br/>The east Mediterranean population includes countries where rapid declines and extinctions have been documented: Georgia (where the last individuals were observed 'several decades ago': N. Paposhvili <em>in litt. </em>2022) and Türkiye, where <em>c. </em>120 breeding pairs at the start of the 1990s had dwindled to none by 2014 (Boyla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Ö.Ü.&#160;Özkoç<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2022).&#160;However, larger numbers than recorded in recent census counts have been reported in Israel (e.g. Meyrav 2022), and the numbers breeding in Syria are unknown, such that there may have been a concentration of this population in the middle of this range. The range of 20-100 individuals for this region (Wetlands International 2022) may be too low, with around 200 recorded near simultaneously in Israel in June 2022 (eBird 2022), but these appear to represent the bulk of the remaining birds hence this population is thought to fall between 150-250 individuals.<br/><br/>There are few recent records of wintering birds in south Asia, though there is little coverage in Pakistan where most would be expected to occur (Green 1993). Hardly any have been reported via eBird in the past few years, which has very high numbers of active users in India&#160;(eBird 2022): the species appears to now be a rare visitor. Consequently it would seem unlikely that there are still 5,000 individuals regularly wintering in this this region, although it is suspected that many of these individuals have shifted their wintering areas or the extent to which they migrate rather than being entirely lost to the global population. Numbers wintering here and separate to those within the south-west Asian population are therefore placed in a band of 1,000-5,000 individuals.<br/>Accordingly, the overall population is here estimated to fall between 15,000-61,250 individuals, rounded to 15,000-61,000 individuals, roughly converted to 10,000-40,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has a fragmented distribution in the western Mediterranean (<strong>Spain</strong>,&#160;<strong>Morocco</strong>,&#160;<strong>Algeria</strong>,&#160;<strong>Libya,</strong>&#160;<strong>Tunisia</strong>,<strong>&#160;Italy </strong>(Sicily and Sardinia)&#160;wintering in north and Sub-Saharan west Africa), the eastern Mediterranean (<strong>Türkiye&#160;</strong>[although possibly now extinct as a breeding species: Boyla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Keller <em>et al. </em>2020],&#160;<strong>Israel</strong>,&#160;<strong>Jordan</strong>,&#160;<strong>Syria</strong>,<strong>&#160;</strong>wintering south to<strong>&#160;Egypt</strong>) and western and southern Asia (<strong>Azerbaijan</strong>,&#160;<strong>Armenia</strong>,&#160;<strong>Russia&#160;</strong>[where it is on the verge of extinction, Van Impe 2013], <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India </strong>and extreme northwest&#160;<strong>China</strong>, wintering in Iran, Pakistan and north-west India) (Green 1996). The degree of separation of these subpopulations is uncertain, and there appear clear linkages between the south-west Asian and east Mediterranean populations. Breeding has formerly been recorded in <strong>Senegal</strong> and potentially the species may have bred in <strong>Chad</strong> (Green 1993).<br/>The western Mediterranean population is concentrated in North Africa, with an estimated 47% of the population in Morocco based on 2019 data&#160;(Ouassou <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021), while the population in Spain has fluctuated but is currently severely reduced, resulting in efforts to counteract declines through releases of captive-reared birds (BirdGuides 2022). It is unclear how many birds currently breeding in Spain are from releases, but more than 95% of the recorded 2021 breeding pairs were apparently captive-reared and released individuals (F. Botelli <em>in litt. </em>2022)&#160;after 860 birds were released&#160;in 2021 (BirdGuides 2022). The population in Italy is very small and has not increased, also leading to conservation efforts involving the release of captive-reared birds in Sicily (Keller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, A. Andreotti <em>in litt. </em>2022).&#160;The breeding population in Türkiye is considered likely extinct with the last confirmed breeding before 2014 (Boyla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Keller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;Formerly, the species bred on the Canary Islands (Cramp and Simmons 1977). It is also extinct in Georgia, where none have been seen for several decades (N. Paposhvili&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2022).&#160;<br/>Very large numbers were recorded following the restoration of the marshes of southern Iraq after 2002, particularly in 2010 when the surrounding region was particularly adversely affected by drought: this probably represented the concentration in this area of most of the south-west Asia non-breeding population. Since then numbers counted have been only a tenth of the peak in 2010 (Wetlands International 2022). The status and trend of the south Asia population are uncertain, with the most recent Waterbird Population Estimates data now 30 years old (Wetlands International 2022). There seem few recent records further east than India: the status of the breeding population in northwest China is uncertain.<br/>The species makes dispersive and nomadic movements in relation to water levels over much of the range: in the east of the range movements are considered more predictable, but it is availability of shallow wetlands in arid areas that principally determines the movements of the species making it a challenging species to monitor.","In Iraq, the species is threatened by illegal hunting and persecution, exacerbated by it being the principal wildfowl target for hunters during the summer months (Salim 2010). Brochet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2019) estimated that&#160;5,000–15,000 individuals are illegally killed per year in the Arabian Peninsula, Iran and Iraq, approximately 17% of the global population.

Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) project surveys were conducted in Iraq by Nature Iraq during 2005-2010, finding c.44,000 individuals in 2010 and resulting in the proposal of several KBAs which hold wintering and breeding populations to be designated as protected areas (Salim 2010). Awareness-raising efforts were carried out in Iraq including the production of posters and hosting of conferences and meetings with hunters and hunting societies by Nature Iraq (Salim 2010). Conservation programmes have been carried out in Spain, with the releases of hundreds of captive-bred birds there since 2000 potentially inflating numbers, albeit habitat degradation continues (A. Green <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). In Italy, reintroduction programmes also continue in Southeastern Sicily, aiming to increase the breeding and wintering populations (C.

These habitats support a high abundance of invertebrates, and provide suitable nesting sites and perches from which the species can forage for arthropods (Illera 2001)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. &#160;It also occurs on the edge of vegetated ""malpaíses"" (lava flows), dry and flowing watercourses, cultivated areas and gardens (Martín and Lorenzo 2001, Seoane <em>et al. </em>2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Generally placed on the (usually sloping) ground among stones and rocks, in cactus thickets, under shrubs (e.g.&#160;<em>L. intricatum</em>) or bushy grass clumps, or low down (below 0·5 m) in a wall or side of barranco and often sheltered by an overhanging stone or bush. Clutch size can be two to five but is usually three-four eggs (Illera and Díaz 2006).&#160; It feeds on invertebrates, including caterpillars, ants, ichneumon flies, flies, centipedes, beetles and spiders (Nicolai and Grimm 2009). &#160;<br/><br/>The species is sedentary although there have been reports of birds possibly dispersing to other islands in the past (Collar 2005), e.g. the bird may have been seen in Lanzarote (<span class=""datalabel1"">Martín and Lorenzo 2001), although this may be confusion with the Common Stonechat (<em>Saxicola torquatus rubicola</em>) (Illera and Seoane 2012).","Increases in infrastructural development, such as tourist and residential centres, road building, industrial plants, mineral operations and golf courses, are destroying the habitat of this species (particularly on the Jandía peninsula in the south of Fuerteventura) (Illera 2001, 2004)<strong></strong>. Additional threats include excessive and increasing livestock grazing (Illera 2001, A.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>Birds are highly migratory in the temperate and Arctic parts of its range, moving from North America to South America, Europe to Africa, and northern Asia to southern Asia and Indonesia. Those breeding at lower latitudes or in the Southern Hemisphere tend to be resident (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits an extreme variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates, from sea level up to c.4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Populations recovered following the ban of harmful hydrocarbons in most countries, which appears important to the birds’ survival (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). While persecution has decreased significantly since the species received legal protection, illegal persecution still occurs in some areas, for example four Peregrines were confirmed illegally poisoned and nine shot, trapped, or nests destroyed in the UK in 2014 (RSPB 2014). Severe population declines in the 1960s-1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Rock climbing activities may pose a threat to the species's nest sites (Global Raptor Information Network 2015), and careless methods of field study may result in abandonment of eggs (White <em>et al. </em>2020). In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). In North Africa, the main threat to the species is illegal trapping and collection of nestlings for use in falconry (Garrido <em>et al. in prep</em>). It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012), and collision or electrocution from electricity cables may be common in some areas (White <em>et al. </em>2020). An oil spill in northern Spain was thought to have reduced reproductive success and caused adult mortality in the local population (Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2006). Urban fledglings are at threat from collisions with cars, windows and other man-made objects (White <em>et al. </em>2020). Warming of sea temperatures may reduce plankton and associated seabirds that serve as a food source for some populations of Peregrine Falcons (Nelson &amp; Myres 1976).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020) estimate the population in the USA/ Canada to be c.72,000 individuals. The North African population is estimated to be 2,290-2,900 pairs (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The European population is estimated at 16,100-31,100 pairs, which equates to 32,200-62,100 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms approximately 13% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 248,000-478,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Agricultural intensification poses a threat through removal of nesting trees and reduction of prey availability such as insects and farmland birds (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001). Shooting is a significant cause of mortality during migration, notably in Malta where hunters are thought to kill 500-600 individuals each year (Sultana 1996, cited in Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001). A growing threat is human disturbance associated with silvicultural and hunting activities during the breeding season (Sergio&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001).&#160;Pesticide use has likely had only minor impacts, as has egg-collecting, which tends to be a local issue (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Large increases in Goshawk populations in some countries has led to higher predation rates of both Eurasian Hobby and corvid species, causing direct mortality and reducing the availability of nest sites (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001).

Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, and those arriving in sub-Saharan Africa do so from October onwards (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The return journey begins from February through until April (the exact time probably dependent on food availability), and is often undertaken in small mixed groups with <em>F. naumanni</em> and occasionally <em>F. vespertinus </em>(Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species can be solitary or gregarious, being most often seen singly but sometimes travelling in flocks of up to 10 individuals, especially on migration.

In Malta, the species was exterminated by shooting, though it has since returned (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The population in much of the rest of Europe has shown a more recent steady decline, thought to be due to agricultural intensification (Snow and Perrins 1998).

Pesticide use has now been reduced to a minor, and largely historical, threat.

Those elsewhere are resident (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Migrants move south between August and November and make the return journey between February and May. Birds tend to occur singly or in pairs, sometimes forming small family groups at roosts. However, they can migrate in groups, and as birds avoid sea crossings (and even freshwater bodies) as far as possible, they form huge concentrations at peninsulas and narrow straits (Brown&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is strictly diurnal, and also often follows mountain ranges and ridges (Brown&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982).&#160;<strong>Habitat&#160;</strong>It inhabits a wide variety of habitats but requires at least some tree cover for nesting and roosting; ideal habitat appears to be forest edge, or mosaics of forest and open areas (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).

In agricultural areas unintentional poisoning from pesticides and rodenticides, or ingestion of led shot are likely causing some localised declines (Coeurdassier&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003, Battaglia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).

Whilst it is a generalist species able to use agricultural and suburban areas, it shows preference for mosiac habitats near woodland, and as such it has suffered from wide-spread agricultural intensification and urban development due to the removal of suitable trees for nesting sites, fragmentation and loss of connectivity with woodlands&#160;(Sergio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Butet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Asian populations are effected by low levels of use and hunting on breeding grounds, as live birds are traded at bird markets in Kuwait (Al-Sirhan &amp; Al-Bathali 2010) and hunted for sport in Jordan (Eid &amp; Handal 2018), but also on migration (Sandor&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;Little is known about threats facing this migratory populations which spend the non-breeding period in southern Africa.","<p>The European population is estimated at 882,000-1,230,000 pairs, which equates to 1,760,000-2,460,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International&#160;<em>in prep</em>).&#160;Europe forms approximately 75% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 2,038,000-3,463,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Modern forestry methods reduce the availability of suitable nesting habitat (Orta <em>et al</em>. 2013). Organochlorine pesticide and heavy metal pollution resulted in reductions in breeding success, particularly in the Baltic region (Orta <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although some losses may be taking place in Asian Russia owing to increased logging and oil industry development, these are outweighed by increases in Europe.<br/>Accidental lead poisoning from spent ammunition remains a considerable source of mortality in Finland (Isomursu <em>et al. </em>2018), with other anthropogenic causes of death including collisions with traffic and power lines or deliberate shooting. Overall, this study found that anthropogenic factors accounted for 60% of eagle deaths. Loss of large trees has left a deficit of suitable nesting sites, and increasing habituation to humans has meant that eagles nest closer to cities (Shiraki 2018). This has increased the number of collisions between eagles and traffic, and may be linked to lower breeding success (ibid). Collisions with wind turbines is an additional source of mortality (Heuck <em>et al.</em> 2019; Matsuda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2021), though the risk can be mitigated with adaptive management (Matsuda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;<br/>Birds are occasionally threatened by outbreaks of avian influenza virus (Krone <em>et al. </em>2018).","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number 10,400-14,600 breeding pairs,   equating to 20,900-29,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This is a highly migratory species, spending the non-breeding phase in in tropical sub-Saharan Africa. It departs breeding grounds in August and September, returning between April and June (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Birds are mostly solitary except on migration, when they flock throughout, gathering in large numbers at preferred crossing points as well as roosting socially (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Porter and Aspinall 2010). They fly chiefly by soaring, although are able to cross wide stretches of water with flapping flight (Snow and Perrins 1998; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is diurnal (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<strong><br/>Habitat </strong>The European Honey-buzzard is a forest species, typically breeding in lowland or mid altitude undisturbed temperate or boreal woodland, but it has been recorded up to 2,000 m (Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). It is also found in wooded farmland, small wetlands and meadows however (Global Raptor Information Network 2021), suggesting a slight tolerance to&#160;cultivated areas. During the non-breeding period in Africa, the species uses woodland, wooded savannah, farmbush and forest edge.&#160;<strong><br/>Diet</strong>&#160;Predominately an insectivore, mainly feeding&#160;on wasps and hornets but also noted to take flying termites and locusts in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> Nests are built in woods, preferentially in deciduous trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong><br/>Management information</strong> The species appears to require dense forest on its wintering grounds in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>Many birds are shot on migration, notably in Italy, Malta and Lebanon (del Hoyo&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2; text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial;text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing: 0px"">et al.</em>&#160;1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and particularly in Georgia. In Georgia the species is hunted for sort, consumption and medicinal properties which means it is the most commonly hunted raptor on migration (van Maanen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Recently it was estimated that hunting in Georgia effects 1.1% of the migratory population which is annually recorded in passage in the country (Hoekstra&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), suggesting low, but significant declines. Direct mortality from shooting on migration was recorded as the highest cause of mortality (De Pascalis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), and whilst European Honey-buzzards suffer from collision-mortality from vehicles and electrocution (Fransson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), these appear more minor compared to shooting. Wind farm projects constructed on main migration routes could be a significant threat, as the species is highly vulnerable to Collison with turbines (Hilgerloh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011; STRIX 2012).<br/>While declines in northern Europe are thought to have resulted from deforestation and forest conversion in the past, European Honey-Buzzards appear relatively robust to changes in breeding habitat, suggesting mortality on migration or during non-breeding grounds is of greater threat (Björklund&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Although pesticide use has not had significant impacts in Europe (due to the species living in woodland and feeding on wasps), it may do in Africa, where there are fewer restrictions on usage and the species may be poisoned through its locust prey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<br/>Relatively less information is available for threats which occur during the African non-breeding period. However, within Africa birds appear reliant on large tracts of continuous forest suggesting widespread deforestation and fragmentation is likely negatively impacting honey-buzzards in Africa (Howes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). &#160;</p>","Ferguson-Lees <em>et al</em>. (2001) estimated the population to number 100,000-1,000,000 individuals, with regional estimates suggesting between 10,000-15,000 pairs in France (Dubois <em>et al</em>. 2008), 1,850 in Spain (Palomino and Valls 2011), 8,000-11,000 in Belarus (Dombrovski and Ivanovski 2005) and 60,000-80,000 in European Russia (Galushin 2012). In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 120,000-175,000 breeding pairs, equating to 241,000-350,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.). Europe forms approximately 82% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 294,000-427,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The global population size is likely much larger than this however, with an annual mean of 528,000 individuals (mostly adults) counted each year passing through the Batumi migratory bottleneck, with 180,000 individuals counted on a single day in 2012 (Hoekstra <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;Hence a revised global estimate is 290,000-430,000 mature individuals.",Stable,"The species breeds across Europe and western Asia, from <strong>Spain </strong>and <strong>France </strong>in the west of its range, across to eastern Scandinavia through to western <strong>Russia</strong>&#160;as far as <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, with the southerly breeding populations in the northern Mediterranean.

Although a captive breeding and release programme is ongoing in Morocco,&#160;evidence that these releases are mitigating the rate of the decline in the wild population is not apparent, nor is there evidence that these ongoing releases have resulted in an additional sustainable subpopulation. To the contrary, monitoring of the area that has received the most released birds over the longest period concludes that the population in a 50,000 km<sup>2</sup> area of eastern Morocco is not viable without ongoing releases, and must now be excluded from this assessment as a managed subpopulation. The loss of a population estimated to be around 3,400 individuals in 2001, at the start of the releases, is additional to a suspected rapid rate of ongoing&#160;reduction in the rest of the range, evidenced by range contraction and reduced densities. Hence the recent rate of population reduction is suspected to have been greater than the ongoing and future rates, and much improved monitoring to discern trends is needed. If further parts of the population are converted through releases to managed subpopulations then the recent rate of reduction will quickly increase and the species will qualify for a higher threat category. The causes of this reduction have not ceased. <br/>Further research is needed to disentangle the impact of large-scale releases wherever these birds end up to determine the effect on the overall population demographics, and hence population viability. It has been stated that the large-scale releases prevented total extirpation from the monitored area in eastern Morocco: if that is true, logically wild populations may soon be extirpated from those areas not subject to such intensive conservation action. But equally, other areas that are subject to the level of intervention are expected to follow the same trajectory to becoming managed subpopulations requiring high inputs of captive-reared birds. Therefore the expansion of the conservation strategy to further areas must be subject to a careful evaluation of outcomes and full disclosure of projected population trajectory prior to the numbers of released birds exceeding the existing wild population. Precise data on known and projected mortality would be essential to informing the conservation in each 'block' of the population where large-scale releases to support the population are proposed: given the effort expended on conservation of this species it would seem a significant oversight if precise hunting take data are not available to assist with these assessments. <br/>In conclusion, a rapid population reduction is continuing throughout the mainland range of African Houbara, which has been exacerbated to a degree by the change to a managed subpopulation of a small but significant proportion of the overall population. The species is accordingly assessed as Vulnerable. However, there is considerable uncertainty over the longer-term status of wild, unmanaged populations of African Houbara in mainland Africa. Were the conservation efforts that have been carried out in eastern Morocco applied across this range there is a considerable risk that the result would be the continued presence of the species, but not as a viable, wild population. Only the small population on the Canary Islands has not received individuals from releases of captive-reared individuals and requires continued protected and monitoring. There is an urgent need to assess the current wild occupancy, abundance&#160;and population trajectory across the historical range in light of this conclusion, and to fully assess the future impact of the release of captive-reared birds to prevent the loss of unmanaged wild populations.&#160;<p></p>","The species inhabits sandy and stony semi-desert and is specialised to arid conditions where trees are absent and both shrub cover and herb layer are sparse (Collar 1979, Goriup 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998, Martí and del Moral 2003), and appears to prefer remote areas away from human settlement (Chammem <em>et al. </em>2012). It feeds on invertebrates, small vertebrates and green shoots, with a generalist and opportunistic diet (Bacon <em>et al.</em> 2019). North African populations may be sedentary or partially migratory, moving relatively short distances to find recent plant growth (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;&#160;<br/>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996). In eastern Morocco, females breed from mid-February to mid-June, and then will generally lay two to three eggs on the ground (Bacon <em>et al. </em>2019). Therefore, eggs and young are susceptible to ground predators.<p></p>","There is an ongoing threat of intensive hunting, which has worsened with the increased use of firearms, off-road vehicles and other technology, with 2,000&#160;birds harvested every year from eastern Morocco since 2014 (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005, Michler 2009, Bacon <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although a captive breeding and release programme has been established with the intent to ensure that hunting is sustainable&#160;(Lacroix <em>et al. </em>2003, Lesobre&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Dolman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, Monnier-Corbel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021), there is no clear evidence that this is supporting wild populations, with 80% of hunted birds in Morocco being captive-bred individuals (Bacon<em> et al.</em> 2019) and the population within the release area no longer viable without ongoing releases of cative-reared birds (Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022). This situation may be partly due to the lower breeding performance&#160;of captive-bred released females relative to wild-born females (Bacon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), but it seems likely that mortality rates throughout the release site remain too high.&#160;Away from Morocco hunting groups have been recorded in Algeria (Berredjouh <em>et al. </em>2016) and is also though to occur in Libya and Mauritania, but there has been no systematic assessment of hunting take across the range.<br/><br/>The primary threat from hunting is compounded by pressures on the species' habitats, from agricultural expansion, over-grazing of livestock, road construction, other infrastructure development and tourism developments (Azafzaf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). There is conflict with urbanisation and agricultural development, as the species favours flat and vegetated plains (Carrascal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). In Tunisia, a growing human presence and land transformation is rapidly leading to the loss of the small remaining populations here (Chammem&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Eggs are also susceptible to trampling by livestock and collection by humans.&#160;Disturbance can be caused by oil exploration activities, along with disturbance associated with other threats. Locust control programmes can lead to direct and indirect poisoning of birds and a reduction in food supply. Floods and droughts cause additional pressures (Azafzaf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>fuertaventurae</em> is threatened by collisions with powerlines (C. González and J.A. Lorenzo <em style="""">in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, Lowen 2007)<strong style=""""></strong>, as well as habitat degradation caused by tourist facilities, off-road vehicles, military exercises, overgrazing, sand extraction and road development, and possibly also nest predation by introduced mammals and illegal hunting (Martín&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1997, Martín and Lorenzo 2001, Martí and del Moral 2003). Recent evidence suggests that the impact of military exercises and hunting have reduced considerably on these islands in recent years, but mortality from powerlines may still be significant (C. González and J.A. Lorenzo <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, Carrascal <em>et al</em>. 2008)<strong></strong>. In Fuerteventura, primary habitat loss of around 13.3% from 1996-2011 was estimated, with a consistent decrease in the species' population of 29% (Banos-González <em>et al. </em>2016).<p></p>","In the mid-1990s this species' population was  estimated to number 10,550 individuals (Goriup 1997).

No overall estimate of the size of the wild population in North Africa has been made since due to the difficulty in adequately sampling across the range. Detailed population monitoring using point counts has been undertaken within the&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Emirates Center for Wildlife Propagation (ECWP) intervention area in eastern Morocco, which totals around 50,175 km<sup>2</sup> (Hardouin <em>et al. </em>2015, Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022). The first assessment of density returned values of 0.05 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in hunting areas and 0.1 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in protected areas, giving an estimate of around 3,400 individuals in the whole area (Hardouin <em>et al. </em>2015, Dolman <em>et al. </em>2021, Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022). If this value is used as a precautionary minimum for half the population size for Morocco (as the species&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">occurs across much of the thorn-scrub desert in southern Morocco, a much larger area but likely at lower densities)</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">, then if the Moroccan total represents approximately 30% of the global population a minimum value for the latter would be around 22,600 individuals, more than double the value suggested by Goriup (1997).<br/><br/>Within the ECWP numbers of birds released increased annually (ECWP 2014,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Hardouin&#160;</span><em>et al.&#160;</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">2015,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022) and this correlates with a rapid increase in the density recorded in surveys, up to 0.76 and 0.84 in 2010 (</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Hardouin&#160;</span><em>et al.&#160;</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">2015,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Monnier-Corbel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2022), corresponding to a peak abundance estimated at&#160;</span>32,401 individuals (95% confidence limits 24,608-42,662) across the ECWP area&#160;(Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022).&#160;This population appears to have then severely declined in the following two years (although Monnier-Corbel <em>et al.</em> [2022] report no significant trend) with the estimated number of individuals in 2013 at 10,409 (8,667-12,500) (data from Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022).&#160;The total number released into this area actually exceeded the estimated population in both 2013 and 2014: subsequently (data to 2018) the population has been comparatively stable, ranging between 13,207-16,329 individuals but with 12,350 and 11,000 released in 2015 and 2016, and 7,050 and 6,700 released in 2017 and 2018 (data from Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022). Monnier-Corbel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2022) conclude that the population within the ECWP does not currently meet criteria for viability and self-sufficiency, mirroring a conclusion published in a 2017 thesis (Bacon 2017) that the 'North African Houbara bustard population is not viable without reinforcement interventions in the long run'. Populations that are regularly supplemented from captive stock to prevent imminent extinction (i.e. within 10 years), as appears to apply within the ECWP area, are not considered in the determination of the species' Red List status except in consideration of species Extinct in the Wild (IUCN 2022). This situation has arisen only recently (Monnier-Corbel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2022) and has had the effect of removing a significant part of the population from the scope of this assessment within the past three generations.<br/><br/>There is also evidence of a contraction in the range and reports of it becoming more difficult to find where it does still occur. It is now very rare in Western Sahara, having suffered a rapid decline in the 20th century (Bergier <em>et al. </em>2017). In Tunisia it is now restricted to remote areas in the extreme south (Chammem <em>et al. </em>2012) which suggests there are far fewer here than previously suspected (D. Jurek&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2015) and there may only be a&#160;few hundred individuals in the country. Very little information is available from Libya, where there have been releases (e.g. 300 in 2010-11) (Dolman <em>et al. </em>2021). There is a very large extent of potentially suitable habitat in Libya, but equally there is hunting and no information on impacts on either population size or demography.&#160;Given the sheer number of released individuals it is now very difficult to assess the wild population size in Morocco and adjacent areas of Algeria. The latter has received relatively few released individuals (although the number that may have dispersed into Algeria from Morocco is unknown and more releases are taking place) and possesses a very large extent of suitable habitat. There do not appear to be any data on hunting levels in Algeria but Berredjouh <em>et al. </em>(2016) noted hunting parties may last more than a month and take several hundred or even a few thousand individuals. The same study found the species was rare but a population remains in&#160;Ouled Djalel, Besbes and Ras Elmiaad regions in Biskra province in central Algeria (Berredjouh <em>et al. </em>2016, Berredjouh&#160;2021). There have never been accurate data from Mauritania, where some releases have taken place, but it is suspected that any population here is small and also subject to an unknown level of hunting.<br/><br/>Applying a three-generation reduction of between 30-50% as suspected to the tentative 2001 value of around 22,000 individuals results in a 2022 total between 10,450 and 14,975 individuals. This is an uncertain value given the lack of quantified data for the majority of the range, and may be a considerable underestimate. There is an urgent need for a rangewide assessment of the current wild population size, and establishing the existing population size is a pre-requisite for each area targeted for large-volume releases to allow evaluation of the impact of releases. While the ECWP release area may no longer be considered part of the wild population for this assessment, there are no barriers to the dispersal of released birds into surrounding, unmonitored areas and many further releases have been made in other locations, notably in Algeria but also in Mauritania and Libya (Dolman <em>et al. </em>2021). No data on the pre-release population in these areas appears to be available and there does not appear to be any ongoing monitoring equivalent to that within the ECWP. While a tentative wild number of individuals is presented here, largely in order to consider plausible population reduction scenarios to inform this assessment of extinction risk, the true number currently living in North Africa (wild, released and offspring of released birds) and how that relates to the wild population size is highly uncertain.&#160;<br/><br/>The Canary Islands subspecies&#160;<em>C. u. fuertaventurae,</em>&#160;is confined to the eastern Canary Islands with a population estimated at 537-577 individuals (Ucero <em>et al. </em>2021). Most&#160;are now on Lanzarote, where the population was almost extirpated due to persecution in the 20th century (Horreo <em>et al. </em>2023) but since hunting was banned in 1971 the population has increased (Schuster <em>et al. </em>2012, Horreo <em>et al. </em>2023) to 440-452 adult individuals in 2018 (Alonso <em>et al. </em>2020), with 460 reported in 2020 (de Colsa <em>et al. </em>2022). A total of 85-109 are present on Fuerteventura (Ucero <em>et al. </em>2021), although 160&#160;individuals were estimated 2020 (de Colsa <em>et al. </em>2022). Not much more than a handful remain on La Graciosa with 12-16 estimated by Ucero <em>et al. </em>(2021). Previous estimates are difficult to compare, with changes to methodologies used and discrepancies in coverage confounding efforts to census what is a difficult species to monitor. In the mid-1990s it was estimated at 527 birds, with 241 on Fuerteventura, 268 on Lanzarote and 18 on La Graciosa (Martin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997) while two studies in the early 2000s placed the population around a thousand birds: Carrascal <em>et al. </em>(2006, 2008) estimated 108-252 birds on Fuerteventura, 272-801 on Lanzarote and 3-10 on La Graciosa&#160;whilst Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>(2007) estimated the population at&#160;<em>c.</em>1,000 birds across all the islands.<br/>Bearing in mind the caveats given above, the overall global population is suspected to fall between 11,000-30,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occurs across a wide range in North Africa. The nominate subspecies<em></em> occurs in northernmost <strong>Mauritania</strong>, <strong>Western Sahara</strong>, <strong>Morocco</strong>, <strong>Algeria</strong>, <strong>Tunisia</strong>, <strong>Libya</strong> and <strong>Egypt</strong> west of the Nile, with old records from <strong>Sudan</strong>, although the current status there is uncertain and it may be extinct (more recent records may pertain to&#160;<em>C. macqueeni</em>).&#160;However, it has been reported that it is becoming more difficult to find the species in Tunisia, it may be close to extinction in Egypt and it may now occur only in disconnected areas in Algeria, which suggests the distribution may be smaller than previously documented (D. Jurek <em>in litt.</em> 2015). In Tunisia, the species was historically widely distributed, but only small relict populations remain in the most remote southern areas (Chammem <em>et al.</em> 2012). Subspecies <em>fuertaventurae</em> is confined to the eastern <strong>Canary Islands, Spain</strong>, with most in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote plus a very small number on the small islet of La Graciosa.<p></p>","The species is hunted, with an estimate of 2,000 birds harvested every year from eastern Morocco since 2014, although these appear to predominantly be captive-bred individuals (Bacon <em>et al</em>. 2019). Illegal poaching is also documented in Tunisia, from both local poachers and falconers (Chammem <em>et al</em>. 2012). Falconer trips of up to a month have been described in Algeria as taking several hundred or perhaps even thousands of individuals (Berredjouh <em>et al. </em>2021). Hunting is also suspected to take place in Libya and Mauritania, though any data on effort or hunting take does not appear to be available.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>				CITES Appendix I.&#160;EU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II.&#160;National legislation protects the species or controls hunting in most range states; however, hunters are often able to circumvent these laws (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;<br/>The nominate subspecies in North Africa was the subject of an action plan (Azafzaf <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). A captive breeding and release programme aimed at population reinforcement is on-going (Lesobre <em>et al</em>. 2009, Dolman <em>et al. </em>2021, Monnier-Corbel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2022). The Emirates Centre for Wildlife Propagation (ECWP) was created in 1995 and manages African Houbara populations within a 50,170 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>intervention area in eastern Morocco, containing protected areas and hunting areas (Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022). There are now captive breeding centres in both Morocco and Algeria, with the majority of birds produced by the International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) at the ECWP at Missour and Enjil in eastern Morocco (IFHC 2013, Dolman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021). In the ECWP area a total of 108,915 individuals were released between 1998-2019 with 90% after 2009 (Monnier-Corbel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022), with&#160;<em>c.&#160;</em>135,000 released over this period in the whole of Morocco (Monnier-Corbel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021).&#160;Releases have also taken place in Mauritania (2,200 in 2017-18), Algeria (9,921 between 2011-2019) and Libya (300 in 2010-11) (Dolman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021). However, despite the very high level of releases the ECWP population does not meet criteria for viability and self-sufficiency (Bacon 2017, Monnier-Corbel <em>et al. </em>2022). The conclusion is that a population of&#160;<em>c.</em>&#160;3,400 individuals in 2001 is now sustained only by continued releases of reared individuals. The programme has preserved the genetic diversity of the species (Lesobre <em>et al. </em>2010, Rabier <em>et al. </em>2020). However it may have introduced traits of domestication into the released birds changing or compromising the demography of the population (Dolman <em>et al. </em>2021).<br/>Subspecies&#160;<em>fuertaventurae</em>&#160;has received improved protection from poaching, reduction of grazing (agricultural decline) and habitat management within protected areas (Martín&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Martín and Lorenzo 2001, Martí and del Moral 2003). SEO/BirdLife purchased a 209-ha reserve to protect the species on Fuerteventura in 2005. Earlier, the introduction of a hunting ban in 1971 on Lanzarote appears to have been instrumental in preventing extinction there: genetic data indicate a severe 20th century bottleneck consistent with reports at the time of the very small population, which has subsequently recovered (Horreo <em>et al. </em>2023).&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Carry out comprehensive and coordinated surveys to establish the total population size and quantify the overall trend, as well as to clarify the current distribution. Establish robust, workable systems for the sustainability of hunting throughout range. Create hunting preserves and other types of managed protected areas.

Monitoring of the European population estimates the recent rate of this reduction at around 25% over 10 years, a rate that approaches the threatened threshold. With the majority of the global population breeding in Europe, it is inferred that this moderately rapid rate of decline is affecting the whole population. As such, Woodchat Shrike is assessed as Near Threatened.</p>","This species requires shrub-like or arboreal cover, open ground offering  rich supply of large insects, and perches with commanding view of area.  It is commonly found in semi-open areas with bushes and well-spaced  trees, such as open woodland, old orchards, olive (<em>Olea</em>) groves,  gardens, and parks or hedgerows with large thorny bushes; in Greece it  prefers open pine (<em>Pinus</em>) forest. In many areas it occurs in cultivated  country with trees; and in the north of its range it is a typical bird  of old traditional orchards, particularly when sheep or cattle present  (Yosef and ISWG 2020). Studies have found that species occurrence can be associated with specific habitat traits; isolated trees, shrubland, and olive groves can for example have positive effects, whereas dirt roads have negative responses (Brambilla <em>et al</em>. 2017). Egg-laying occurs from the end of April through to  July. The nest site is  chosen by the male and both sexes build the nest (Lefranc and Worfolk  1997), which is a compact open cup made from twigs and roots and other  plant material, lined with rootlets, hair, wool, moss, lichen and spider  web. It is generally placed on a lateral branch of a tree, often fruit  tree or oak, pine or poplar or in the Mediterranean area, in low dense  brush. Clutches are four to eight eggs (Yosef and ISWG 2020). It feeds  principally on insects but other invertebrates, voles, mice, lizards,  frogs and occasionally plant material such as berries are also taken  (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997). The species is migratory, wintering in Africa south of the Sahara but north of the equator and in small numbers in southern Arabia (Yosef and ISWG 2020).","Loss and degradation of habitat through agricultural intensification,  afforestation, and large fires are the main threats to this species  (Yosef and ISWG 2020). The abandonment of traditional charcoal-making, the  canalization of rivers and heavy use of herbicides and insecticides are  also threats (Tucker and Heath 1994). Long-term climatic changes  resulting in wetter springs have caused the range of the species to  contract southwards (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is hunted around  ponds in summer and on migration in Italy. A decline in insect prey across breeding areas may also be responsible for population reductions (N. Baccetti <em>in litt</em>. 2022). In addition, drought in the  Sahel and changes to agricultural practices in its wintering grounds may  lead to long term population declines (Tucker and Heath 1994).","The European population is estimated at 1,930,000–3,120,000&#160;pairs, which equates to 3,860,000–6,240,000 mature individuals&#160;(BirdLife International 2021).

219149911,159971,Danaus plexippus,Least Concern,,2022,2021-08-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Monarch Butterfly (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) is widely recognized for its remarkable long-distance migration. Native to the Americas, from southern Canada to northern South America, breeding populations of this species are now found around the world. These more recently established populations are excluded from the Red List assessment as they are dependent on host plant species which are non-native to these areas (see Geographic Range text).<br/><br/>Only the North American subspecies, <em>D. p. plexippus</em>, is considered migratory and there are two primary migration patterns. East of the Rocky Mountains, over several generations, butterflies migrate back and forth from overwintering sites in the Oyamel Fir forests of Central Mexico to summer breeding areas across the eastern United States and southern Canada. Similarly, in western North America, butterflies migrate from overwintering sites along the Pacific Coast to breeding areas in all U.S. states west of the Rocky Mountains. The subspecies <em>D. p. megalippe</em>, found in the Neotropics from Florida, through southern Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America, to northern South America, breeds year-round and does not embark on long distance migrations. As larvae, Monarch Butterflies feed almost exclusively on Milkweed (<em>Asclepias </em>spp.).<br/><br/>Long term population declines, primarily due to habitat loss in overwintering sites and host plant declines in summer breeding areas, have been observed in the migratory subspecies, <em>D. p. plexippus</em>. In the last 10 years, the population size appears to have stabilized, though these subpopulations remain at high risk of quasi-extinction due to stochastic events. However, where this species is non-migratory, the population size and trend are not known with certainty, though the population is thought to be stable. Due to the widespread nature of this species, overall large population size, and declines likely to be less than 30%, the risk of extinction remains low. Therefore, this species is assessed as Least Concern. However, because the migratory phenomenon is certainly at risk, conservation efforts should continue, and additional research on the non-migratory subspecies should be carried out to ensure population stability.","Monarchs prefer open habitats including native prairies, weedy fields, meadows, marshes and roadsides (Opler and Wright 1999). This species is seldom found in heavily forested areas, mountains, or desert regions (Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al</em>. 2014, Brock 2008). Males are often seen patrolling open fields to search for females during the breeding season (Opler and Wright 1999). Adults feed on the flowers of their larval host plant, milkweed (<em>Asclepias spp</em>.), as well as many other types of flowers, especially composites (Family: Asteraceae) (Opler and Wright 1999, Brock 2008). Like other milkweed butterflies (species in the <em>Danaus</em> genus), Monarch larvae feed on milkweeds (<em>Asclepias </em>spp.) and other plants in the Apocynaceae family (Opler and Wright 1999, Brock 2008). Larvae sequester cardenolide secondary compounds contained within the milkweed sap, making them distasteful to predators as larvae and adults (Jones and Agrawal 2016).<br/><br/>Monarchs in the North American migratory subspecies overwinter in large colonies within Oyamel Fir (<em>Abies religiosa</em>) forests of central Mexico (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014) or forested groves along the coast of California. In the spring, the butterflies come out of reproductive diapause and mate before dispersing (Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2015). From Mexico, butterflies head north, reaching southern Canada and the northeastern United States by midsummer (Malcom <em>et al</em>. 1993). From coastal California, monarchs disperse northward and eastward, eventually reaching interior parts of the West including Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Arizona (Dingle <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2015), and probably other areas west of the Rocky Mountains, including as far north as southern British Columbia (Pyle 2015).","Where declines in the migratory sub-species have been observed, the main threats are degradation of breeding habitat, loss of overwintering habitat, and climate change associated increases in severe weather events (The Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al</em>. 2014, Shahani <em>et al</em>. 2015, Crone <em>et al</em>. 2019). Threats to the non-migratory subspecies are not documented, but outside the core range within North America, threats appear to be minimal.<br/><br/>For the migratory subspecies, the main threat in summer breeding areas is increased agricultural intensification and associated declines in milkweed host plants and nectar sources (Pleasants and Oberhauser 2013, Flockhart <em>et al.</em> 2015). For example, in the Upper Midwest region, Pleasants and Oberhauser (2012) found milkweed had declined by as much as 58% from 1999 to 2010. Milkweed losses have recently been exacerbated by an increased use of glyphosate herbicides within croplands, resulting from expanded use of herbicide resistant genetically modified (GM) corn and soybean crops (Pleasants and Oberhauser 2012, Flockhart <em>et al.</em> 2015). Other threats to milkweed include aggressive management of rights of way and roadside vegetation in the form of mowing and herbicide spraying, urban development, urban landscaping practices, and loss of croplands (Borders and Lee-Mader 2014). At overwintering sites in both Mexico and California, habitat loss and forest fragmentation continues to be problematic (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2002). From 1971 to 1999, 44% of 42,020 hectares of suitable overwintering habitat in Mexico was degraded as a result of commercial logging (legal and illegal), conversion for agriculture and pastures, charcoal production, and controlled burns (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2002). More recently, deforestation due to logging has slowed and reserves have been established to protect this habitat (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). However, enforcing protections has not always been successful and habitats are still under pressure due to illegal logging, agriculture, urban development, grazing, fires, forest disease, water diversion for human use, and climate change (Vidal <em>et al</em>. 2013, Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al</em>. 2014, Brower <em>et al</em>. 2016). In California, the main driver of habitat loss is urban development and a lack of proactive management (Jepsen and Black 2015). Since 1985, at least 76 overwintering sites have been lost and many additional sites have been degraded due to wildfire, minor tree trimming or removal, drought, tree pests, and mismanagement (Sakai and Calvert 1991, Pelton <em>et al</em>. 2016, Pelton 2020).<br/><br/>Severe weather and climate change have also been suggested as threats for the migratory subspecies. Habitat suitability models predict overwintering sites in Mexico and California will become less suitable in the coming years (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2018, Oberhauser and Petersen 2003). Severe weather events, which are increasing in frequency, are also problematic. For example, a particularly cold, wet storm in 2002 killed as many as 500 million butterflies (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2002). On the other hand, warmer temperatures may deplete lipid reserves and expedite reproductive development, leading to early departures from overwintering areas (Oberhauser and Petersen 2003). Increased incidence of drought is also likely to adversely impact monarchs. Availability of floral resources along autumn migration routes is critical to fall migration success and is positively correlated with abundance at over wintering sites in both Mexico and California (Stevens and Frey 2010, Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>Other noted threats include parasites and pathogens and increased insecticide use. The native protozoan parasite <em>Ophryocistis elektroscirrha</em> (OE), which reduces fecundity in heavily infected individuals, has increased in incidence since the 1990s (Altizer 2001, Thogmartin <em>et al</em>. 2017b). Increased insecticide use has been implicated in declines of butterfly population in both California and the UK (Gilburn <em>et al</em>. 2015, Forister <em>et al</em>. 2016). In exposure trials conducted on Monarch larvae in the field, neonicotinoid (clothianidin) exposure caused sublethal and lethal effects, such as slower development, lower body mass, and caused higher mortality rates (Pecenka and Lundgren 2015). Neonicotinoid use in particular is concerning because its use has increased 48-fold from 2003 to 2010 in the United States (Thogmartin <em>et al</em>. 2017b).","Due to yearly monitoring of the migratory subspecies (<em>Danaus plexippus plexippus</em>) at over wintering sites in California and Mexico, current population estimates for a portion of the population are available. During the 2020–2021 winter season, surveys found monarchs occupying 2.10 hectares of forest in Mexico (World Wildlife Fund Mexico 2021). While the estimated number of Monarchs per hectare varies from 6.9 to 60.9 million (Calvert 2015), 21.1 million is widely used as a best estimate (Thogmartin <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Therefore, there were an estimated 44 million butterflies at overwintering sites in Mexico during the 2020–2021 season. During the same season in California, surveys documented only 1,914 butterflies (Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021). The counts for the western migratory population have never been so low, and experts have suggested that the migration is vulnerable to collapse once population size dips below the threshold of 30,000 individuals (Schultz <em>et al</em>. 2017). Despite reliable data for the migratory subspecies, total population size estimates are unknown for <em>D. plexippus</em> at the species level, because there is little population data available for the non-migratory subspecies <em>D. p. megalippe</em>, which occupies a substantial portion of the total range from the Caribbean south, through Central America, to northern portions of South America.<br/><br/>Long term declines for both eastern and western migratory populations of the subspecies <em>D. p. plexippus</em> have been reported (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2011, Semmens <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2017). The most pronounced declines for the eastern migratory population were seen from 1996 to 2014, when the population declined by 84% (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the last 10 years, declines have slowed, and the population has stabilized around 55 million individuals, with butterflies occupying an average of 2.59 ha each winter. However, Semmens <em>et al</em>. (2016) suggest 6 ha of occupied forest is needed to maintain a resilient eastern migratory population. Though the population may appear stable, below 6 ha of occupied forest, overwintering colonies may not be large enough to maintain the appropriate microhabitat conditions to prevent from freezing (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016). Due to these factors, this population has a quasi-extinction risk of 5–43% over the next 20 years (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016). For the western migratory population, an estimated population size of 3 to 10 million in the 1980s, has declined to less than 1,914 individuals in the winter season of 2020–2021, a decline of 99.9% (Pelton and Knight 2021, Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021). Based on log-scale geometric growth models developed by Schultz <em>et al.</em> (2017) and modified by Voorhies <em>et al.</em> (2019) to include additional data from 2016 to 2019, estimated annual population growth for the western migratory population is 0.839. Based on this current growth rate and a quasi-extinction threshold ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 individuals, Voorhies <em>et al.</em> (2019) suggest a 99.99% risk of quasi-extinction over 50 years. Individuals outside the naturally native range were not taken into account for this analysis.<br/><br/>Where this species is non-migratory, the population trend is not known with certainty, although it is thought to be stable (NatureServe 2020). As mentioned, it is unknown what percentage of the total population the migratory individuals represent. Therefore, total population declines cannot be estimated, and the extinction risk is unknown. However, it is unlikely that declines are over the 30% threshold for classification as Vulnerable. It is also likely that this species would remain at low risk of extinction even if the North American migratory phenomena collapsed.",Decreasing,"The Monarch Butterfly, <em>Danaus plexippus</em>, is primarily distributed throughout the Americas, from southern Canada, through the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America, to South America, north of the Amazon Basin (Opler and Wright 1999). In North America, this species undergoes an iconic annual migration. Every year, millions of Monarch Butterflies travel from overwintering sites in Central Mexico and coastal California, to summer breeding grounds throughout the United States and Canada (Urquhart and Urquhart 1978). By the late summer and fall, after several generations, individuals embark on the return journey, travelling distances up to 4,000 km (Brower 1996). However, in much of its neotropical range within the Americas and elsewhere, this species does not participate in continental scale migrations and can be found year-round as a resident (Opler and Wright 1999). Some short distance seasonal migrations, from lowlands to highlands or coastal to inland areas, often still take place in these regions (Zhan <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Monarchs are also found in many other parts of the world, including Europe (mostly southern Spain, Portugal, the Azores and the Canary Islands), Australia, New Zealand, many Pacific Islands, including Hawai‘i, Taiwan and the Philippines (Opler and Wright 1999, Neves <em>et al</em>. 2001, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2005). In most cases, it is thought that occasional visitors or vagrants, often blown in by big weather events, eventually became established (Clarke and Zalucki 2004). There are now breeding populations in many of these regions (Neves <em>et al</em>. 2001, Zalucki and Clarke 2004). In the countries of occurrence table for this assessment, these populations are listed as ""native"" as the species reached these areas naturally. However, the Monarch is generally considered native only in the Americas and the Caribbean, because the host plants utilized elsewhere are non-native, having been introduced in the last several hundred years (Fernández-Haeger <em>et al</em>. 2015, Buden and Tennent 2017). These more recently established populations are not likely to be viable if the non-native host plants are eradicated in these areas. For these reasons, these populations are excluded from the Red List assessment.<br/><br/>The estimated extent of occurrence for this species (including only the resident population in the Americas and the overwintering regions of the migratory subspecies) is at least 17 million km². This species is too widespread to get an accurate estimated area of occupancy (AOO).<br/><br/>There are at least two subspecies of <em>Danaus plexippus </em>currently recognized: <em>D. p. plexippus</em> is the migratory subspecies found in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Canary Islands, Madeira, the Azores, Bermuda and numerous Pacific islands including Hawai‘i, Australia and New Zealand; <em>D. p. megalippe</em> is the non-migratory subspecies found in southern Florida and throughout the Caribbean, Central America, and South America north of the Amazon Drainage (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). Pelham (2008) recognizes several colour varieties of <em>D. p. megalippe</em>, including<em> portoricensis</em>, <em>leucogyne</em>, and <em>tobagi,</em> as additional subspecies<em>.</em>","The Monarch is one of nine butterflies permitted for release across state lines by the US Department of Agriculture (Pyle 2010), except in Washington and Oregon, which have placed state limits on this practice. It is therefore often reared by commercial breeders to be sold, usually for educational or ceremonial purposes (Pyle 2010). It is also utilized by the Butterfly House Industry (BHI), which is estimated to be worth 100 million dollars (USD) a year (Boppré and Vane-Wright 2012). Some commercial operations collect a portion of their stock from wild populations (Pelton 2018), but as neither industry is regulated, it is unclear to what extent this is the case.<br/><br/>In Mexico, the Monarch is a tourist attraction at its overwintering sites in the Oyamel Fir forests of Michoacán and Estado Mexico (Vidal <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is a similar draw at some sites in coastal California, including in the communities of Pacific Grove, Pismo Beach, and Santa Cruz. It is unclear whether this eco-tourism impacts this species.",Terrestrial,"Many, mostly voluntary, conservation efforts are underway across North America to protect the migratory phenomena of the migratory subspecies. There are few, if any, conservation efforts in place to protect this species outside its migratory range. In Mexico, the overwintering sites have been protected, with varying levels of success, since 1975 (Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al</em>. 2014). Most recently, the Mexican government set aside 56,259 hectares of forest, running in a belt along the border of Michoacán and Estado Mexico, to form the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR), which remains in place today (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). In 2008, the MBBR became a UNESCO World Heritage Site (UNESCO 2013). Canada has also taken steps to protect Monarchs, including the creation of an International Network of Monarch Butterfly Reserve, with Mexico, in 1995, and listing the Monarch as a species of special concern under the Species at Risk Act in 2003 (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014, Shahani <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the United States, the migratory subspecies has been petitioned for protections under the Endangered Species Act (The Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al</em>. 2014). The US Fish and Wildlife Service (2021) recently announced that listing the monarch was “warranted but precluded by higher priority actions”. Over 85 federal and state agencies, non-governmental organizations, businesses and academic programs collaborate on monarch conservation projects, such as habitat restoration, milkweed planting, and community science data collection (Monarch Joint Venture 2020).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The full petition ruling is available <a href=""https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/SPC-Ruling-Monarch_Butterfly-27Sept2023.pdf"">here</a>.<br/><br/>The main issue raised in the petition was the appropriateness of the models used to calculate the 10-year population reduction using data on the area occupied by wintering individuals. Although the assessment period is 10 years, the 2021 assessment fitted linear and exponential models to the data from 1993 to 2020 (the last year of data available at the time of the assessment). After investigation, the SPC noted that the exponential model can be considered plausible with the data that were available at the time of the assessment, however, based on the distribution of its residuals, the linear model cannot be considered plausible.&#160;<br/><br/>However, linear and exponential are not the only options; more complex models may be used depending on information about the processes that contribute to changes in population size (see section 4.5.1 of the Red List Guidelines; IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2022). In this case, a break-point model, which detected a changepoint in 2014, is also plausible (Thogmartin <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although Thogmartin <em>et al</em>. (2020) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the eastern migratory monarch population had significantly grown since winter 2014, they did detect a changepoint in 2014 (or 2013), a point at which the rate of change had increased from a decline to a much lower rate of decline, or to no decline, or to a small rate of increase. Importantly, the changepoint seems to correspond to a stabilization of herbicide use and habitat loss (Thogmartin <em>et al</em>. 2017), suggesting a plausible mechanism for this change in population trend.<br/><br/>Based on these considerations and on the information provided in the assessment, both Vulnerable (VU) and Near Threatened (NT) are plausible categories, but Endangered (EN) is not. In addition, the reduction is based on an index of abundance (subcriterion b) but not direct observation (subcriterion a). Thus, the listing is changed to VU A2b, with both VU and NT identified as plausible categories.","Monarchs prefer open habitats including native prairies, shrub-scrub, weedy fields, meadows, marshes and roadsides (Opler and Wright 1999, Dilts <em>et al.</em> 2019). This subspecies is seldom found in heavily forested areas or mountainous regions (Brock 2008, Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al.</em> 2014). Males are often seen patrolling open fields to search for females during the breeding season (Opler and Wright 1999). Adults feed on the flowers of their larval host plant, milkweed (<em>Asclepias </em>spp.), as well as many other types of flowers, especially composites (Family: Asteraceae) (Opler and Wright 1999, Brock 2008).<br/><br/>Like other milkweed butterflies (species in the <em>Danaus</em> genus), Monarch larvae feed on milkweeds (<em>Asclepias </em>spp.) and other plants in the Apocynaceae family (Ackery and Vane-Wright 1984). Larvae sequester cardenolide secondary compounds contained within the host plant, making them distasteful to predators as larvae and adults (Jones and Agrawal 2016). The Viceroy (<em>Limenitis archippus</em>) is also distasteful and is morphologically similar to the Monarch and another milkweed butterfly, the Queen (<em>D. gilippus</em>), forming a Mullerian mimicry complex that works by reinforcing the distastefulness of this morphology (Brock 2008).<br/><br/>Monarchs are best known for their long-distance migrations. Having travelled as much as 4,000 km (Brower 1996), migratory individuals from the eastern United States and Canada start arriving in Mexico in early November (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2004). They form large colonies within Oyamel Fir (<em>Abies religiosa</em>), pine (<em>Pinus</em> spp.), and sometimes White Cedar (<em>Cuppressus lindleyi</em>) or oak (<em>Quercus</em> spp.) forests (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). Colonies typically appear on slopes with southwest exposure, probably due to UV radiation requirements and fewer bird predators (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). These aggregations allow them to maintain critical temperatures as they spend the winter in reproductive diapause (Anderson and Brower 2008). In late March or early April, diapause ends and reproductively active individuals mate before dispersing northward. Females seek out young milkweed plants and begin laying eggs (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2006). By midsummer, the entire range is repopulated, and some individuals have reached Canada and the northeastern United States (Malcom <em>et al.</em> 1993). The fourth or fifth brood emerges in late summer or early fall and will eventually make the trip back to the overwintering grounds in Mexico.<br/><br/>Individuals engaging in the shorter distance, western migration travel from regions west of the Rocky Mountains to settle in as many as 450 sites along a 1,000 km stretch of coast from northern California to Baja California, Mexico (Jepsen <em>et al.</em> 2015, Pelton <em>et al.</em> 2016). The monarchs cluster in groves made up of non-native eucalyptus trees (<em>Eucalyptus </em>spp.) and native trees, such as Monterey Pine (<em>Pinus radiata</em>), Cypress (<em>Cupressus macrocarpa</em>), Coast Redwood (<em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>), and oaks (<em>Quercus </em>spp.), among other species (Griffiths and Villablanca 2015, Jepsen and Black 2015, Pelton <em>et al</em>. 2016). Adults begin arriving at these overwintering sites from September to November and most spend the winter in reproductive diapause (Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2015). In February and March, monarchs breed and then the females leave the overwintering sites and disperse into the foothills and interior valleys of California, seeking early spring emerging milkweeds. Females oviposit as they disperse northward and eastward, eventually reaching interior parts of the West including Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Arizona (Dingle <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2015), and probably other areas west of the Rocky Mountains, including areas as far north as southern British Columbia (Pyle 2015).","Various threats have been implicated in the decline of monarch populations, including the degradation and loss of breeding and migratory habitat, the degradation and loss of overwintering habitat, climate change and the associated increases in severe weather events, pesticides including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, roadside mowing regimes, invasive species, urban development, logging, and disease (The Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al.</em> 2014, Shahani <em>et al.</em> 2015, Thogmartin <em>et al</em>. 2017, Wilcox <em>et al</em>. 2019). Migratory populations are especially susceptible to threats because they congregate in small areas for part of the year, are reliant on suitable habitats across enormous areas during the breeding season, and are susceptible to weather events during migrations.<br/><br/>For the eastern migratory population, increased agricultural intensification and associated declines in milkweed host plants and nectar sources within core breeding areas throughout the United States has long been considered a major threat (Pleasants and Oberhauser 2013, Flockhart <em>et al.</em> 2015). For example, in the Upper Midwest region, Pleasants and Oberhauser (2013) found milkweed had declined by as much as 58% from 1999 to 2010. Milkweed losses are largely the result of increased use of glyphosate herbicides within croplands, resulting from expanded use of herbicide resistant genetically modified (GM) corn and soybean crops (Pleasants and Oberhauser 2013, Flockhart <em>et al.</em> 2015). Studies have shown that Monarchs traditionally heavily utilized milkweed within corn and soybean fields (Oberhauser <em>et al.</em> 2001), and in the Midwest, approximately 10 million hectares of herbicide resistant GM crops were planted from 2007 to 2014 (Jepsen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Other threats to milkweeds include aggressive management of rights of way and roadside vegetation, through mowing and herbicide spraying, urban development, urban landscaping practices, and loss of grasslands and croplands (Borders and Lee-Mader 2014).<br/><br/>At overwintering grounds in Mexico, historical habitat loss and forest fragmentation probably contributed to early declines in Monarch numbers (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2002). From 1971 to 1999, 44% of 42,020 hectares of suitable overwintering habitat was degraded as a result of commercial logging (legal and illegal), conversion for agriculture and pastures, charcoal production, and controlled burns (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2002). More recently, deforestation due to logging has slowed and reserves have been established to protect this habitat (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). However, enforcing protections has not always been successful and habitats may still be under pressure from illegal logging, agriculture, and urban development (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2016). For example, even after monarch reserves were established in 2002, 1,254 hectares were deforested and 925 hectares were degraded from 2001–2012, mostly because of illegal logging (Vidal <em>et al.</em> 2013). Degradation is problematic because intact forest canopies are essential for maintaining the proper microclimates that protect butterflies from moisture during storms and prevent radiational cooling from exposure to the open sky, both of which increase the likelihood of freezing and mortality (Anderson and Brower 2008). Furthermore, Saunders <em>et al.</em> (2019) found winter abundances could be predicted by forest cover in overwintering grounds. While local authorities and philanthropic organizations work together to effectively enforce protections, which reduced illegal logging substantially between 2008 and 2012 and again from 2012 to 2018, regional social and economic issues remain, jeopardizing long-term conservation efforts (Vidal <em>et al.</em> 2013, Flores-Martínez <em>et al.</em> 2019). Remaining threats to habitat include grazing, fires, agricultural expansion, forest disease, water diversion for human use, and climate change (Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Similarly, the declines in the western migratory population have been attributed to the loss and degradation of overwintering habitat, loss and degradation of breeding and migratory habitat, pesticides, climate change, and other factors (Crone <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pelton <em>et al</em>. 2019). Individuals are especially at risk in their overwintering stage, as they are clustered into small areas and are vulnerable to severe weather events. Urban development and a lack of proactive management have contributed to the continued loss of coastal grove habitats for decades (Jepsen and Black 2015). For example, from 1985 to 1991, Sakai and Calvert (1991) documented the loss or destruction of 38 overwintering sites, 16 of which became housing developments. Then, between 1991 and the early 2010s, 17 additional sites were lost, 11 of which were in Santa Barbara County (Pelton <em>et al.</em> 2016). These losses continue, with 21 additional sites being severely damaged since 2016, due to excessive tree trimming by utility companies, development, and various other forms of mismanagement (Pelton 2020). Many additional sites have been degraded due to wildfire, minor tree trimming or removal, drought, tree pests, and mismanagement (Pelton 2020).<br/><br/>Severe weather and climate change have also been suggested as threats for both migratory populations. In the western US for example, one habitat suitability model suggests overwintering sites will shift inland, away from the coast, and to higher elevations as a result of climate change (Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2018). Similarly, climate change at the high-altitude overwintering sites in Mexico is suspected to make habitats less suitable in the coming years. For example, from 2012–2018, 163.44 ha of forest in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) were lost due to climate-related factors, primarily tree fall during high wind and rain (Flores-Martínez <em>et al.</em> 2019). Another study suggested conditions across the entire overwintering range in Mexico will no longer be suitable under most future climate change scenarios, due to predicted warmer temperatures and increased incidence of winter precipitation (Oberhauser and Petersen 2003). If cold winter precipitation penetrates the forest canopy, wet butterflies are at a higher risk of freezing (Anderson and Brower 2008). For example, a particularly cold, wet storm in 2002 killed as many as 500 million butterflies (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2002). Other mass mortality events took place in 2004 and 2016, affecting the 2003 and 2015 population estimates. Estimated mortality during these events ranged from 40% to 70% (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2004, Brower <em>et al.</em> 2017). In addition, the population fluctuates from year to year in response to weather conditions during the breeding season. In 2012, hot weather in the spring led to a smaller than average population. Warmer spring temperatures deplete lipid reserves and expedite reproductive development, leading to early departures from overwintering areas (Oberhauser and Petersen 2003). The combination of this smaller springtime population and cooler weather during breeding led to the lowest population size on record (0.67 ha), in 2013.<br/><br/>In summer breeding areas, the effects of climate warming on Monarchs will probably be mixed (Malcolm 2018). As Monarchs are dependent on the availability of milkweed, the effects of climate change on Monarchs are largely contingent on host plant response to climate change. For example, while warmer temperatures may make summer breeding habitats farther north more suitable for Monarchs, it is unclear how quickly host plants will be able to colonize these new areas (Batalden <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, models predict the current summer breeding range will become less suitable for Monarchs and their milkweed host plants (Lemoine 2015). This change may adversely impact the spring migration because butterflies may have to migrate farther to reach suitable habitats, at a time when their lipid resources are at their lowest levels (Malcolm 2018). There is also some evidence that warmer years may lead to phenological mismatch between Monarchs and their host plants or nectar sources (Thogmartin <em>et al.</em> 2017b).<br/><br/>Increased incidence of drought will also likely adversely impact Monarchs. Availability of floral resources along autumn migration routes is critical to fall migration success and is positively correlated with abundance at overwintering sites in Mexico (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2019). Texas is particularly important during the migration, and drought years in Texas are correlated with below average colony sizes at overwintering sites (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2019, Taylor&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020). Under most climate change scenarios, much of the autumn migration corridor will experience more frequent and severe drought, which will likely adversely impact abundance at overwintering colonies in Mexico. Similarly, increased severity and frequency of drought is likely a significant climate change related threat faced by the western migratory population. Moisture availability in key breeding regions of Arizona, California, Nevada, and Oregon was examined from 1998–2007, and was found to accurately predict the variance in abundance of individuals at overwintering sites (Stevens and Frey 2010). Furthermore, a study looking at whether climatic conditions could predict population trends found that higher levels of spring precipitation had positive effects on population numbers, as did higher spring and winter temperatures (Espeset <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Parasites and pathogens are also a risk to monarch populations. The native protozoan parasite <em>Ophryocistis elektroscirrha</em> (OE) reduces fecundity in heavily infected individuals and renders them less fit for long-distance migrations, due to smaller wing sizes and lower mass (Altizer 2001). Incidence of this parasite is higher in non-migratory populations, which could be problematic, as some migratory Monarchs are forgoing migration due to the increasing presence of non-native ornamental tropical milkweed (<em>Ascelpias curassavica</em>) in the Gulf States and southern California (Satterfield <em>et al.</em> 2015, Satterfield <em>et al.</em> 2016). Furthermore, the incidence of this parasite has increased from 1% in the 1990s to 10% in 2010 (Thogmartin <em>et al.</em> 2017b). Other significant parasitoids of Monarchs include a suite of tachinid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae), seven species of which have been found to parasitize the larval stage (Oberhauser&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017). Oberhauser <em>et al.</em> (2017) found 17% of wild collected 5th instar larvae were parasitized, resulting in considerable larval mortality.<br/><br/>Commercial butterfly rearing could be harmful to wild populations of Monarch butterflies. The release of captive individuals disrupts the normal distribution of species and leads to biogeographical confusion, which is counterproductive to conservation efforts and the understanding of species distributions (Pyle 2010, Pelton 2018). Furthermore, one study found that captive-reared monarchs were unable to orient on release, which likely adversely impacts their ability to migrate (Tenger-Trolander <em>et al</em>. 2019). There is also some evidence the practice of releasing captive-reared individuals contributes to higher rates of disease and loss of genetic diversity in wild populations (Pelton 2018, Tenger-Trolander <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>Insecticide use also likely adversely impacts monarch populations, though as its use has increased in concert with herbicides, it may be difficult to differentiate the effects of these two factors (Agrawal 2019). Neonicotinoid use in particular, which increased 48-fold from 2003 to 2010 in the United States (Thogmartin <em>et al.</em> 2017b), has been implicated in declines of butterfly populations in both California and the UK (Gilburn <em>et al.</em> 2015, Forister <em>et al.</em> 2016). In exposure trials conducted on Monarch larvae in the field, neonicotinoid (clothianidin) exposure caused sublethal and lethal effects, such as slower development and lower body mass, and caused higher mortality rates (Pecenka and Lundgren 2015).&#160;Similarly, aerial applications of foliar pesticides to manage soybean aphids, caused mortality in Monarchs due to cuticular and dietary exposure, as far as 60 metres downwind (Krishnan <em>et al</em>. 2020). Insecticide and fungicide contamination of milkweed host plants at levels damaging to monarchs has been documented in the field in both the Midwest and California (Olaya-Arenas and Kaplan 2019, Halsch <em>et al.</em> 2020). Despite these risks, the benefit of planting milkweed in proximity to agricultural areas likely outweighs the risk of mortality due to pesticide drift (Grant <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>Finally, evidence suggests several invasive plants are unfavourable to monarchs. As mentioned previously, Tropical Milkweed (<em>Ascelpias currasavica</em>), which is planted as an ornamental in the southern United States, stays in bloom year-round and provides food for Monarch larvae through the winter (Batalden and Oberhauser 2015). Foregoing migration and breeding through the winter in these areas is now common (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2010) and may lead to higher incidence of disease (Satterfield <em>et al.</em> 2015). Another problematic set of plants, introduced from Europe, are Black Swallow-wort (<em>Cynanchum louisea</em>) and Pale Swallow-wort (<em>Cynanchum rossicum</em>). These two plants are members of the milkweed family (Apocynaceae), and female butterflies often lay their eggs on these plants, even when native milkweeds are also present (Casagrande and Dacey 2007). Larvae cannot feed on these plants however, so they act as oviposition sinks, while also outcompeting native milkweeds (Casagrande and Dacey 2007).","<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong><strong>: The text below is from the original (2021) assessment, which calculated reductions that meet the Endangered criterion A threshold. Since then, this assessment has been subject to a petition, which resulted in the assessment being changed to Vulnerable (see the Rationale for an explanation).</strong><br/><br/>Yearly monitoring of the Monarch (<em>Danaus plexippus plexippus</em>) at overwintering sites in California (western migratory population) and Mexico (eastern migratory population) has been ongoing since the 1990s (World Wildlife Fund Mexico 2021, Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021). For the eastern migratory population, yearly counts based on the area of overwintering colonies are widely used as best estimates for effective population size. During the 2020–2021 winter season, surveys found monarchs occupying 2.1 hectares of forest in Mexico (World Wildlife Fund Mexico 2021). While the estimated number of Monarchs per hectare varies from 6.9 to 60.9 million (Calvert 2015), 21.1 million is widely used as a best estimate (Thogmartin <em>et al.</em> 2017a). Therefore, there were an estimated 14.5 to 127.9 million, with a best estimate of 44.3 million butterflies at overwintering sites in Mexico during the 2020–2021 season. During the same season in California, surveys documented only 1,914 butterflies, a dramatic drop from already low counts around 30,000 in the two years prior (Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021).<br/><br/>Long term declines for both eastern and western migratory populations of this subspecies have been reported (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2011, Semmens <em>et al.</em> 2016, Schult <em>et al.</em> 2017), possibly extending as far back as the 1970s (Zylstra <em>et al</em>. 2020). The most pronounced declines for the eastern migratory population were seen from 1996 to 2014, when the population declined by 84% (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the last 10 years, declines have slowed, and the population appears to have stabilized around 55 million individuals, with butterflies occupying an average of 2.59 ha each year. However, given the high variability in population size from year to year, it may be premature to assume the decline has stabilized. When such annual variability exists, it is appropriate to fit a decline model to the whole time series and calculate a population reduction based on the fitted values (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2019, Akcakaya <em>et al.</em> 2021). Therefore, yearly population estimates from 1993 to 2020 (World Wildlife Fund Mexico 2021) were fit to linear and exponential models of decline. These models suggest a population size reduction of 46–72% respectively, when measured over 10 years. More sophisticated population models have been developed to identify population growth rates of the eastern migratory population. In one example, a multivariate first-order auto-regressive state-spaced model was developed and fit using both area of forest occupied in overwintering grounds and total annual egg production in parts of the summer breeding range (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016). Voorhies <em>et al.</em> (2019) modified this model to include additional data from 2016 to 2019. Through this approach, an annual growth rate of 0.976 was suggested for the eastern migratory population. Under this estimated rate of decline, the population reduction calculated over the last 10 years is 22%. Therefore, the population reduction for the eastern migratory population, over the last 10 years, is estimated to be 22–72%. <br/><br/>As mentioned, current rates of decline for the eastern migratory population are less concerning than they were in past years. Presently, the immediate concern is whether enough individuals remain to bolster against the impacts of stochastic events. To assess quasi-extinction risk and provide a target population size for conservation purposes, Semmens <em>et al</em>. (2016) created a multivariate first-order auto-regressive state-spaced model. The model was fit using both area of forest occupied in overwintering grounds and total annual egg production in parts of the summer breeding range. It suggests 6 ha of occupied forest is needed to maintain a resilient eastern migratory population. Though the population may appear stable, below 6 ha of occupied forest, overwintering colonies may not be large enough to maintain the appropriate microhabitat conditions to prevent from freezing (Anderson and Brower 1996, Brower <em>et al</em>. 2008). The quasi-extinction probability suggested by the model is 1–26% over the next 10 years, depending on the quasi-extinction threshold considered (based on the current population size of 2.1 ha and with a population growth rate of 1.0) (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016). Under the same parameters, over 20 years, quasi-extinction risk is 5–43%. The quasi-extinction thresholds considered were between 0.01 and 0.25 ha of occupied forest.&#160;For context, as the density of monarchs in one hectare of forest is suggested to be between 6.9 and 60.9 million individuals (Calvert 2004), at 0.05 ha of occupied forest, there may be as few as 345,000 individuals, and at 0.01 ha there may be as few as 69,000 individuals (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, the lowest extinction threshold considered, 0.01 ha, is equivalent to the smallest colony size reported to date. If this threshold were reached, all but one small colony, vulnerable to extinction by winter storm (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2004), would remain. Therefore, expert opinion favoured an extinction threshold closer to 0.25 ha, and no lower than 0.05 ha (Semmens <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>For the western migratory population, an estimated population size of 3 to 10 million in the 1980s had declined to 1,914 individuals in the winter season of 2020–2021, a decline of 99.9% (Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021, Pelton and Knight 2021). Though preliminary data from the 2021 count suggests a modest rebound, with counts totalling above 247,237 individuals, the current population size remains extremely low compared to historic levels (Pelton <em>et al</em>. 2021). Based on log-scale geometric growth models developed by Schultz <em>et al.</em> (2017) and modified by Voorhies <em>et al.</em> (2019) to include additional data from 2016 to 2019, estimated annual population growth for the western migratory group is 0.839. Under this estimated rate of decline, the population reduction calculated over the last 10 years is 83%. Similarly, when yearly population estimates from 1997 to 2020 (Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021) are fit to linear and exponential models of decline, as was done with the eastern migratory population, a population size reduction of 66–91%, measured over 10 years, was calculated.<br/><br/>The same models developed by Schultz <em>et al.</em> (2017) and modified by Voorhies <em>et al.</em> (2019) also determined the risk of quasi-extinction for the western migratory population. Based on a quasi-extinction threshold ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 individuals, Voorhies <em>et al.</em> (2019) suggest a 99.99% (99.47–99.95) risk of quasi-extinction over 20 years. While this estimate was considered a worst-case scenario, where growth rate has declined to 0.8089 from the current rate of 0.839, it is still considered plausible (Voorhies <em>et al.</em> 2019). For the western migratory population, the quasi-extinction threshold was again based on expert opinion on the densities required for adequate thermoregulation and mate finding (Wells <em>et al</em>. 1990, Schultz <em>et al</em>. 2017). However, it is possible this quasi-extinction threshold is set too high; while the western migratory population fell below this extinction threshold in 2019 and 2020, the most recent 2021 data has shown a slight rebound.<br/><br/>In summary, when the eastern and western migratory populations are considered together, using the same variety of methods discussed above, the estimated population size reduction over the last 10 years is 22–72%. This estimate mirrors that calculated for the eastern migratory population, as the number of individuals in this population far outweighs the number of individuals in the western migratory population. The risk that both migratory populations will reach their respective quasi-extinction thresholds over the next 20 years is 5–43% (calculated by multiplying 99.9%, for the western migratory population, by 5–43%, for the eastern migratory population).<br/><br/>Non-migratory individuals that overwinter in Arizona, Florida, and along the Gulf coast were not included in the population size or trend estimates or in the estimates for quasi-extinction probability. Due to occasional deep freeze events, these populations probably do not remain viable without influx from migratory populations (NatureServe 2015) and therefore provide no rescue effect. Individuals outside the naturally native range were also not taken into account.",Decreasing,"The Migratory Monarch Butterfly, <em>Danaus plexippus plexippus</em>, is primarily distributed within North America, and can be found at various times of year from southern Canada, through the United States, to Central Mexico (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). Throughout its native range, this subspecies undergoes an iconic annual migration. Every year, millions of monarch butterflies travel from overwintering sites in central Mexico and coastal California to summer breeding grounds throughout the United States and Canada. By the late summer and fall, after subsequent generations, the migratory generation embarks on the return journey, travelling distances up to 4,000 km (Brower 1996).<br/><br/>Monarchs probably belonging to this subspecies are also found in many other parts of the world, including Europe (southern Spain, southern Portugal, the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands), Bermuda, and many Pacific Islands (including Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hawai’i) (Neves&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, Zalucki and Clarke 2004, Smith&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Fernández-Haeger <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nail <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In Europe, the Monarch is probably introduced, as it does not appear in collection records until the 1800s (Neves <em>et al.</em> 2001). Additionally, all three host plants utilized in this region, <em>Gomphocarpus fruticosus, G. physocarpus, </em>and <em>Asclepias curassavica</em>, are introduced, the former two from southern and eastern Africa and the latter from Cuba or Mexico (Fernández-Haeger <em>et al.</em> 2015). Historically, it was considered an occasional visitor or vagrant, but as recently as the 1990s, breeding populations were established in the Azores and elsewhere (Neves <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>In the Pacific Islands, the most common host plants are also recently introduced, such as the common ornamental milkweed, <em>Calotropis gigantea</em>, in Micronesia and Hawai’i (Buden and Tennent 2017), although native host plants do occur in Southeast Asia. Curiously, there may be a long history of the Monarch Butterfly in New Zealand. For example, the Maori people have a common name for the species. Therefore, it is plausible that dispersion events across the Pacific occurred thousands of years ago (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most argue, however, that monarchs did not establish breeding populations in the region until more recently, within the last 200 years or so (Zalucki and Clarke 2004). There are no known breeding populations of this species in Asia, so where it has been found it is likely to be a vagrant (NatureServe 2015). In many regions outside its native range, the monarch is no longer migratory, as suitable conditions exist year-round for breeding (Nail <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Australia, however, monarchs are partially migratory, with some individuals breeding year-round, specifically in northeastern coastal areas, and others migrating as much as 380 km, to form overwintering roosts (James 1993, Smithers 1977).<br/><br/>In the countries of occurrence table for this assessment, these populations are listed as ""native"" as the species reached these areas naturally. However, the Monarch is generally considered native only in the Americas and the Caribbean, because the host plants utilized elsewhere are non-native, having been introduced in the last several hundred years (Fernández-Haeger <em>et al</em>. 2015, Buden and Tennent 2017). These more recently established populations are not likely to be viable if the non-native host plants are eradicated in these areas. For these reasons, these populations are excluded from the Red List assessment.<br/><br/>The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) for this species (including only the areas to which it is naturally native, and restricted to the overwintering grounds in central Mexico and coastal California) is almost 450,000 km². The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of this species (based on the same native overwintering grounds) is 444–1,030 km². The lower bound was calculated by considering the number of overwintering sites occupied during yearly counts for both migratory populations during the 2020–2021 winter season. This included 102 sites in California (Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021) and nine in Mexico (World Wildlife Fund Mexico 2021). Each site occupies just one grid cell, as no site is larger than the standard 4 km² grid size. The upper bound includes all suitable overwintering habitat in Mexico, calculated to be 562 km² (Slayback <em>et al.</em> 2007), as populations fluctuate and colonies shift around from year to year. However, as only a fraction of this suitable habitat is occupied at any given time, the lower bound of the estimate (444 km²) is considered to be more accurate. In addition, while monarchs were counted at 102 historical overwintering sites in California, only 35 sites contained more than 10 individuals (Xerces Society Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count 2021). Historically, the EOO and AOO were probably larger, but many overwintering habitats have been lost or degraded. Non-migratory individuals that overwinter in southern California, Florida, and parts of the Gulf Region were not taken into account, as these populations would probably not remain viable without influx from migratory groups (NatureServe 2015). The number of locations is likely to be larger than 10, as there are around 35 sites in California alone, that are considered to be within separate locations as the main threat, habitat loss, will impact each site differently.","The Monarch is one of nine butterflies permitted for release across state lines by the US Department of Agriculture (Pyle 2010), except in Washington and Oregon, which have placed state limits on this practice. It is therefore often reared by commercial breeders to be sold, usually for educational or ceremonial purposes (Pyle 2010). It is also utilized by the Butterfly House Industry (BHI), which is estimated to be worth 100 million dollars (USD) a year (Boppré and Vane-Wright 2012). Some commercial operations collect a portion of their stock from wild populations (Pelton 2018), but as neither industry is regulated, it is unclear to what extent this is the case for the Monarch.<br/><br/>In Mexico, the Monarch is a tourist attraction at its overwintering sites in the Oyamel Fir forests of Michoacán and Estado Mexico (Vidal <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is a similar draw at some sites in coastal California including in the communities of Pacific Grove, Pismo Beach, and Santa Cruz. It is unclear whether this eco-tourism impacts this species.<p></p>",Terrestrial,"Many voluntary conservation efforts are underway across North America to protect the migratory phenomena of this subspecies (Shahani <em>et al.</em> 2015, Monarch Joint Venture 2020). Continued preservation of Monarchs and their unique migration entails protection of habitats in overwintering grounds, migration corridors, and summer breeding areas. This massive undertaking requires continued international cooperation and support from government agencies, scientists, and non-profit organizations. While progress has been made, further legal protections may be useful to prevent further habitat loss and degradation. Specifically, improved protection of overwintering sites in Mexico and in California is recommended.<br/><br/>In Mexico, after overwintering sites became known outside of Mexico in 1975, a reserve was established, although few specific protections were outlined (Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al.</em> 2014). Later, in 1986, a presidential decree established the Monarch Butterfly Special Biosphere Reserve, which protected a total of 16,110 ha, including a core zone of 4,491 ha, where no extractive activities were permitted. These protections were poorly enforced and by 1999, 75% of the highest quality forest patch was destroyed and 44% of patches with over 80% canopy cover were degraded (Brower <em>et al.</em> 2002). In 2000, the Mexican government set aside 56,259 hectares of forest, running in a belt along the border of Michoacán and Estado Mexico, to form the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR), which remains in place today (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). Although this designation aimed to protect forests from logging and other threats, degradation continued. Finally, in 2012, due to increased support from local authorities and philanthropists, efforts to protect overwintering sites effectively halted illegal logging, and the amount of land impacted decreased from 731 hectares between 2005 and 2007, to only 5.18 hectares in 2014 (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). In 2008, the MBBR became a UNESCO World Heritage Site (UNESCO 2013). Currently, within the MBBR, 13,000 hectares of core habitat, with a buffer zone of 42,000 ha, has been set aside to preserve overwintering sites (Jepsen <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition to the MBBR, the Monarch Fund (Fondo Monarca) was set up to compensate landowners for any monarch conservation measures they participate in, and as many as 25 Non-Governmental Organizations collaborate on Monarch conservation projects through the Monarch Network (Shahani <em>et al.</em> 2015). Despite this work, the need to prevent continued illegal logging and manage ecotourism in overwintering sites in Mexico remains (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014, Brower <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Canada has also taken steps to protect Monarchs. In 1995, Canada and Mexico signed a declaration to create an International Network of Monarch Butterfly Reserves (Shahani <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2003, Canada listed Monarchs as a species of special concern under the Species at Risk Act (Vidal and Rendón-Salinas 2014). This provides the species with legal protections. Habitat improvement projects, undertaken by volunteers and several governmental agencies, are also underway to conserve breeding habitats (Shahani <em>et al.</em> 2015). The Monarch is also listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC 2016).<br/><br/>In the United States, this subspecies has been petitioned for protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (The Center for Biological Diversity <em>et al.</em> 2014). In December 2020, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) announced that listing the Monarch was “warranted but precluded by higher priority actions” (USFWS 2020). With this decision, the Monarch became a candidate for listing under the ESA, so it will be reconsidered for inclusion annually. Over 85 federal and state agencies, non-governmental organizations, businesses and academic programs collaborate on monarch conservation projects, such as habitat restoration, milkweed planting, and community science data collection, through Monarch Joint Venture (Monarch Joint Venture 2020). For example, various milkweed planting initiatives, such as efforts undertaken by the U.S. Forest Service, US Farm Bill conservation programmes, and the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) are underway across summer breeding regions (Shahani <em>et al.</em> 2015). Many conservation efforts in the United States have focused on the summer breeding range of the eastern migratory population. More attention on the western migratory population is essential, as the overwintering sites along the California coast are still in need of protection and management and the population may be teetering on the verge of collapse (Jepsen and Black 2015, Pelton <em>et al.</em> 2019), despite a recent modest rebound of the population in 2021 (Pelton <em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><br/>In addition to habitat conservation and restoration, education and outreach as well as research and monitoring have been identified as necessary conservation priorities for the Monarch (Monarch Joint Venture 2021). Outreach is key to increasing habitat for monarchs, creating advocates for local policy changes, and educating the public on the harms of noxious weeds and pesticides, among other things (Monarch Joint Venture 2021). The main research needs to be identified, include monitoring overwintering habitats, coordinating existing habitat protection efforts, gaining a better understanding of threats and factors that influence breeding and migration, and evaluating the success of conservation actions (CEC 2021, Monarch Joint Venture 2021).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
